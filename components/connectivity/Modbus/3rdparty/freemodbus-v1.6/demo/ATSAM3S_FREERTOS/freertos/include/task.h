 *
 * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the
 * task remains blocked depends on the tick rate.  The constant
 * portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.
 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 *
 * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
 * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
 * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
 * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
 * of controlling the frequency of a cyclical task as the path taken through the
 * code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency
 * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
 * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
 * unblock.
 *
 * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that
 * the calling task should block.
 *
 * Example usage:

 *
 * Delay a task until a specified time.  This function can be used by cyclical
 * tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.
 *
 * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
 * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
 * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.
 *
 * The constant portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the

 *
 * @param xTimeIncrement The cycle time period.  The task will be unblocked at
