/*
Changes from V1.01

	+ More use of 8bit data types.
	+ Function name prefixes changed where the data type returned has changed.

Changed from V2.0.0

	+ Added the queue locking mechanism and make more use of the scheduler
	  suspension feature to minimise the time interrupts have to be disabled
	  when accessing a queue.

Changed from V2.2.0

	+ Explicit use of 'signed' qualifier on portCHAR types added.

Changes from V3.0.0

	+ API changes as described on the FreeRTOS.org WEB site.

Changes from V3.2.3

	+ Added the queue functions that can be used from co-routines.

Changes from V4.0.5

	+ Added a loop within xQueueSend() and xQueueReceive() to prevent the
	  functions exiting when a block time remains and the function has
	  not completed.

Changes from V4.1.2:

	+ BUG FIX:  Removed the call to prvIsQueueEmpty from within xQueueCRReceive
	  as it exited with interrupts enabled.  Thanks Paul Katz.

Changes from V4.1.3:

	+ Modified xQueueSend() and xQueueReceive() to handle the (very unlikely) 
	case whereby a task unblocking due to a temporal event can remove/send an 
	item from/to a queue when a higher priority task is	still blocked on the 
	queue.  This modification is a result of the SafeRTOS testing.
