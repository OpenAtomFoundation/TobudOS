/*
 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * xLists can only store pointers to xListItems.  Each xListItem contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.
