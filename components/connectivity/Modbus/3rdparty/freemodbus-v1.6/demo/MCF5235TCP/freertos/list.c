/*
Changes from V1.2.0

	+ Removed the volatile modifier from the function parameters.  This was
	  only ever included to prevent compiler warnings.  Now warnings are
	  removed by casting parameters where the calls are made.

	+ prvListGetOwnerOfNextEntry() and prvListGetOwnerOfHeadEntry() have been
	  removed from the c file and added as macros to the h file.

	+ uxNumberOfItems has been added to the list structure.  This removes the
	  need for a pointer comparison when checking if a list is empty, and so
	  is slightly faster.

	+ Removed the NULL check in vListRemove().  This makes the call faster but
	  necessitates any application code utilising the list implementation to
	  ensure NULL pointers are not passed.

Changes from V2.0.0

	+ Double linked the lists to allow faster removal item removal.

Changes from V2.6.1

	+ Make use of the new portBASE_TYPE definition where ever appropriate.

Changes from V3.0.0

	+ API changes as described on the FreeRTOS.org WEB site.

Changes from V3.2.4

	+ Removed the pxHead member of the xList structure.  This always pointed
	  to the same place so has been removed to free a few bytes of RAM.

	+ Introduced the xMiniListItem structure that does not include the 
	  xListItem members that are not required by the xListEnd member of a list.
	  Again this was done to reduce RAM usage.

	+ Changed the volatile definitions of some structure members to clean up
	  the code where the list structures are used.

Changes from V4.0.4

	+ Optimised vListInsert() in the case when the wake time is the maximum 
	  tick count value.
