/*
Changes from V1.00:
	
	+ Call to portRESTORE_CONTEXT has been removed.  The first context
	  switch is now performed within sPortStartScheduler().

Changes from V1.01:

	+ More use of 8bit data types.
	+ Function name prefixes changed where the data type returned has changed.
	+ configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY is no longer defined by default.

Changes from V1.2.0

	+ Introduced ucTopReadyPriority.  This tracks the highest priority ready
	  queue that contains a valid TCB and thus makes the context switch
	  slightly faster.

	+ prvAddTaskToReadyQueue() has been made a macro.

Changes from V1.2.6

	+ Added conditional compilation directives.
	+ Extended API.
	+ Rearranged function order.
	+ Creating a task now causes a context switch if the task being created
	  has a higher priority than the calling task - assuming the kernel is
	  running.
	+ vTaskDelete() now only causes a context switch if the calling task is
	  the task being deleted.

Changes from V2.0.0

	+ Allow the type of the tick count to be 16 or 32 bits.
	+ Introduce xPendingReadyList feature to allow the time interrupts have to
	  be disabled to be minimised.
	+ Remove the #if( INCLUDE_vTaskSuspendAll ) statements.  vTaskSuspendAll()
	  is now always included as it is used by the scheduler itself.

Changes from V2.1.0

	+ Bug fix - pxCurrentTCB is now initialised before the call to
	  prvInitializeTaskLists().  Previously pxCurrentTCB could be accessed
	  while null.

Changed from V2.1.1

	+ Change to where lStackSize is declared within sTaskCreate() to prevent
	  compiler warnings with 8051 port.

Changes from V2.2.0

	+ Explicit use of 'signed' qualifier on portCHAR types added.
	+ Changed odd calculation of initial pxTopOfStack value when
	  portSTACK_GROWTH < 0.
	+ Removed pcVersionNumber definition.

Changes from V2.5.3

	+ cTaskResumeAll() modified to ensure it can be called prior to the task
	  lists being initialised.

Changes from V2.5.5

	+ Added API function vTaskDelayUntil().
	+ Added INCLUDE_vTaskDelay conditional compilation.

Changes from V2.6.0

 	+ Updated the vWriteTraceToBuffer macro to always be 4 byte aligned so it
	  can be used on ARM architectures.
	+ tskMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN definition replaced with the port specific
	  configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN definition.
	+ Removed the call to strcpy when copying across the task name into the
	  TCB.
	+ Added ucTasksDeleted variable to prevent vTaskSuspendAll() being called
	  too often in the idle task.

Changes between V3.0.0 and V2.6.1

	+ When resuming the scheduler a yield is performed if either a tick has
	  been missed, or a task is moved from the pending ready list into a ready
	  list.  Previously a yield was not performed on this second condition.
	+ Introduced the type portBASE_TYPE.  This necessitates several API
	  changes.
	+ Removed the sUsingPreemption variable.  The constant defined in
	  portmacro.h is now used directly.
	+ The idle task can now include an optional hook function - and no longer
	  completes its time slice if other tasks with equal priority to it are
	  ready to run.
	+ See the FreeRTOS.org documentation for more information on V2.x.x to
	  V3.x.x modifications.

Changes from V3.1.1

	+ Modified vTaskPrioritySet() and vTaskResume() to allow these functions to
	  be called while the scheduler is suspended.
	+ Corrected the task ordering within event lists.

Changes from V3.2.0

	+ Added function xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle().

Changes from V3.2.4

	+ Changed the volatile declarations on some variables to reflect the 
	  changes to the list definitions.
	+ Changed the order of the TCB definition so there is commonality between
	  the task control block and a co-routine control block.
	+ Allow the scheduler to be started even if no tasks other than the idle
	  task has been created.  This allows co-routines to run even when no tasks
	  have been created.
	+ The need for a context switch is now signalled if a task woken by an 
	  event has a priority greater or equal to the currently running task.
	  Previously this was only greater than.

Changes from V4.0.0

	+ Added the xMissedYield handling.

Changes from V4.0.1

	+ The function vTaskList() now suspends the scheduler rather than disabling
	  interrupts during the creation of the task list.  
	+ Allow a task to delete itself by passing in its own handle.  Previously 
	  this could only be done by passing in NULL.
	+ The tick hook function is now called only within a tick isr.  Previously
	  it was also called when the tick function was called during the scheduler
	  unlocking process.

Changes from V4.0.3

	+ Extra checks have been placed in vTaskPrioritySet() to avoid unnecessary
	  yields.

Changed from V4.0.4

	+ Bug fix:  The 'value' of the event list item is updated when the priority
	  of a task is changed.  Previously only the priority of the TCB itself was
	  changed.
	+ When resuming a task a check is first made to see if the task is actually
	  suspended.
	+ vTaskPrioritySet() and vTaskResume() no longer use the event list item.
	  This has not been necessary since V4.0.1 when the xMissedYield handling
	  was added.
	+ Implement xTaskResumeFromISR().

Changes from V4.0.5

	+ Added utility functions and xOverflowCount variable to facilitate the
	  queue.c changes.
