 *
 * Hashing a password:

 *	char hash[BCRYPT_HASHSIZE];
 *	int ret;
 *
 *	ret = bcrypt_gensalt(12, salt);
 *	assert(ret == 0);
 *	ret = bcrypt_hashpw("thepassword", salt, hash);
 *	assert(ret == 0);
 *
 *
 * Verifying a password:
 *
 *	int ret;
 *
 *      ret = bcrypt_checkpw("thepassword", "expectedhash");
 *      assert(ret != -1);
 *
 *	if (ret == 0) {
 *		printf("The password matches\n");
 *	} else {
 *		printf("The password does NOT match\n");
 *	}
