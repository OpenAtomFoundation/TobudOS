*** New features
*****************

** ANT **

- Added the new ANT Secure DFU Bootloader example.
  The example demonstrates how to use the new ANT transport with Secure DFU components
  (with support only for SES and GCC toolchains).
- Removed legacy ANT bootloader solution.


** Drivers and libraries **

- nrf_cli can now prompt and autocomplete both sorted and unsorted subcommands.
- nrf_libuarte and nrf_libuarte_async now support multiple instances.


** BLE**

- nrf_ble_lesc (part of the Peer Manager) now supports the LESC OOB pairing mode.
  The ble_nfc_pairing_reference_c example demonstrates how to pass the OOB data to the module.


** DFU **

- Added the option to perform signature validation of the application on each boot.
  This functionality requires nrfutil version 5.0.0 or higher.
- The DFU procedure can now mandate strictly increasing application versions.
- Added the option to send applications that will not be activated, but will remain in slot 1 ("external applications").
  This functionality requires nrfutil version 5.0.0 or higher.
- Added masking of GPREGRET and GPREGRET2 registers, enabling the upper 3 bytes of each register to be used by the application independently of the bootloader.

** Crypto **

- Added nrf_crypto backend support for Infineon OPTIGA™ Trust X devices (selected features).
- Added new example to showcase Infineon OPTIGA Trust X functionality: examples/crypto/ifx_optiga_custom_example.


*** Changes
************

** DFU **

- Turned off Link Time Optimization in all DFU projects due to instabilities in the supported GCC compiler.

** Drivers and libraries **

- nrf_cli: CLI will now automatically add the `\r` character before each printed `\n` character.
  This feature can be switched off in sdk_config using flag `NRF_FPRINTF_FLAG_AUTOMATIC_CR_ON_LF`.
- USB: A complete list of changes is available under this link: https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/blob/a0dcb1350f6798f12479921a0a376d00e2316fd4/CHANGELOG.md

** NFC **

- The NFC libraries (nfc_t2t_lib and nfc_t4t_lib) now use the NFCT driver instead of the NFC HAL modules (hal_nfc_t2t and hal_nfc_t4t). 
  The NFCT driver is a part of nrfx repository.
- Replaced hal_nfc_t2t and hal_nfc_t4t components with the nrfx_nfct driver.
- Added the NFC platform module (nfc_platform) to abstract runtime environment specific implementation from the driver.
  HFCLK activation, required for NFC to operate correctly, is managed in this module.
- Removed the nfc_fixes.h file with NFC workaround description. The content of this file was moved to nrfx_nfct.h.

** Crypto **

- nrf_oberon, nrf_cc310, and nrf_cc310_bl libraries have changed naming and placement compared to the previous release.
  They are now available in the following folder scheme:
  - GCC and IAR 8.x: lib/<arch>/hard-float/<lib_name>.a
  - IAR 7.80.x: lib/<arch>/hard-float/short-wchar/<lib_name>.a
  - Keil: lib/<arch>/hard-float/short-wchar/<lib_name>.lib
  Due to this naming convention change, updated nrf_cc310 and nrf_cc310_bl library version to 0.9.12.
  Due to this naming convention change, updated nrf_oberon library version to 2.0.7.
- Changed ECC Public Key Validation from "Full" to "Partial" in nrf_crypto backend for ARM CC310.
  This improves LESC pairing and ECDSA verify timing.


*** Bug fixes
****************

** Drivers and libraries **

- nrf_cli: The module can now be used with terminals with no standard background color (for example, white).
- USB: Fixed a bug where USB IRQ was not cleared after unplugging the USB cable.
- Fixed an issue where NRF_LOG_INIT(timestamp, frequency) failed to compile if the logger was disabled.
- Fixed a compilation failure issue when using NRF_LOG_HEXDUMP_WARNING.
- Fixed a scenario where the emulated project delay function (nrfx_coredep_delay_us) did not work correctly.

** BLE **

- Peer Manager:
   - Slave Security Requests received during a pairing or encryption procedure will now be ignored (to align with the BLE specification).
   - Fixed a bug where Peer Manager would misinterpret a peer central's ability to resolve resolvable addresses in directed advertisements.
   - Fixed a bug where Peer Manager would sometimes give a fatal error if the link disconnected during a pairing procedure.
   - Fixed a bug where flash could be full but no Peer Manager event was sent.
   - Fixed a bug where Peer Manager would silently drop Service Changed indications if an ATT MTU exchange was happening at the same time.
- Eddystone:
   - Fixed a bug where EID was not correctly updated.
   - Fixed bug where factory reset would not work correctly when followed by an immediate disconnect.

** DFU **

- Various security improvements and fixes.
- Fixed various bugs in background DFU.
- Fixed bugs that appeared when combining transports (for example, UART + BLE).

** DTM **

- Fixed a bug which made the workaround for nRF52840 Anomaly 172 non-functional.

** Serialization **

- Fixed an issue with HCI transport sending redundant bytes on certain packet payloads containing escape codes.
- Fixes in serialization codecs.


*** Known Issues
****************

** General **

- Programming and debugging the nRF52811 chip may require an update of the J-Link firmware in order to recognize the new chip.
- The workaround for Anomaly 198 for nRF52840 SPIM3 peripheral that has been implemented in nrfx_spim cannot be used with a SoftDevice.
  Flag NRFX_SPIM3_NRF52840_ANOMALY_198_WORKAROUND_ENABLED must be set to zero.
  The workaround based on a dedicated RAM block for SPIM3 must be used instead.

** BLE **

- GATTC: the ble_gattc_service_t::uuid field is incorrectly populated in the BLE_GATTC_EVT_PRIM_SRVC_DISC_RSP event
  if the sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover() or sd_ble_gattc_read() are called when a Primary Service Discovery by Service UUID is already ongoing.
  When the application has called sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover(), it should wait for the BLE_GATTC_EVT_PRIM_SRVC_DISC_RSP event before calling sd_ble_gattc_primary_services_discover() or sd_ble_gattc_read().
- The TFTP Background DFU example has known instabilities.

** Drivers and libraries **

- The SAADC driver does not handle detection limits 'high' and 'low' correctly if SAADC resolution is greater than 10 bits.
- USBD: 
  - The library may handle Remote Wakeup incorrectly.
  - Issuing a SET_ADDRESS(0) request does not cause the device to change its state to default.
  - The device does not STALL when a DATA transaction is received outside of SETUP. It ACKs instead.

** IoT **

- For Linux kernels >= 4.12, The BLE_6LOWPAN_LEGACY_MODE configuration parameter must be set to 0 (the default is 1).
  The default value must be kept for Linux kernels < 4.12.
  With this configuration set up incorrectly, the examples do not work and are difficult to debug.



======================================================================

nRF5 SDK v15.2.0
------------------------
Release Date: Week 37, 2018
 
This SDK release is an update replacing the non-published nRF5 SDK release v15.1.0.
The main updates compared to v15.1.0 are summarized in the last three points of the Highlights section.

Highlights:
 - Added support for the new SoftDevices S140, S132, and S112 v6.1.0.
 - Added new targets for running S112 on nRF52832 (PCA10040).
 - Updated ESB library to support all nRF52 devices (nRF52810, nRF52832 (Rev.1 & Rev.2), and nRF52840).
 - Updated SDFU to include nRF52810 target (PCA10040E).
 - Released nrf_log in production quality.
 - Removed the workaround in nrf_sdh.c overriding the default priority level on SWI interrupt SD_EVT_IRQn and RADIO_NOTIFICATION_IRQn used by the SoftDevice.
 - Changed the default interrupt priority level for the peripherals from 7 to 6. This is done to be aligned with the priority of the SWI coming from the SoftDevice.

*** New features
*****************
 
** BLE **
 - Added new targets to demonstrate the use of S112 on nRF52832 (PCA10040).
 - Added "Property Read" for the Object Transfer Service client (ble_app_ots_c).
 - Added a Scanning Module to simplify scanning for BLE devices in central role.
 - Peer Manager:
    - peer_manager_handler.h: There are now standard event handlers available to users of the Peer Manager.
       The event handlers provide features like logging, automatically securing the link, and automatically
       deleting the oldest bond if the flash is full.
    - PM_RA_PROTECTION_ENABLED: The Peer Manager can now be configured to reject repeated security requests
       from peers that failed pairing.
    - PM_LESC_ENABLED: Improved LESC support.
    - PM_LOG_ENABLED: Added error and warning level logging messages to the Peer Manager.
    - PM_EVT_FLASH_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_FAILED: Added new event.
    - PM_PEER_DATA_ID_CENTRAL_ADDR_RES: Added automatic storing of the peer's Central Address Resolution value during bonding.
    - pm_peer_id_list(): Added a new function for creating lists of Peer IDs, including some filtering.
 - Added LESC support to the following examples: ble_app_hrs, ble_app_hrs_c, and ble_app_gls.
 - Added support for nRF52840 (PCA10056) in the beacon example (ble_app_beacon).
 - Added Swift Pair support to the HID mouse example (ble_app_hids_mouse).
 - Battery Service: Added the possibility to notify a reconnected, bonded peer of an updated battery level.
    This feature is demonstrated in the Immediate Alert Server example.
 
** Crypto **
 - EdDSA: Added support for Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (Ed25519).
 - In documentation, added a table showing supported nrf_crypto backends for different examples:
    http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.2.0/nrf_crypto_default_backends.html
     
** DFU/Bootloader **
 - Added a new target to the SDFU example to demonstrate SDFU running on nRF52810 (PCA10040E). In a single bank update, there is only
    about 60 kB of flash available. This restricts what can be updated.
 - The bootloader settings page is now backed up before being updated. This increases protection from corruption caused by chance events
    (for example, power failure) and malicious apps.
 - The advertising interval of BLE DFU can now be configured in sdk_config (NRF_DFU_BLE_ADV_INTERVAL).
 - The size of the application data area that is left alone by the bootloader can now be configured
    in sdk_config (NRF_DFU_APP_DATA_AREA_SIZE).
 - The bootloader code now supports most of nrf_crypto backends. However, the size of the binary will likely be too large if other backends
    are used, so you will need to accomodate by increasing the size of the bootloader.
 
** USB **
 - Added response/no response to an IN token on ISO IN endpoint with a ZLP when no data is ready. This can be set with USBD_CONFIG_ISO_IN_ZLP.
 - Added support for configuration string ID.
 - Added an option to give priority to isochronous transfers using USBD_CONFIG_DMASCHEDULER_ISO_BOOST.
 - Implemented SOF event callback in interrupt for classes.
 - Added an enum and get function for a selected protocol (boot or report) in HID. Implemented a SET_PROTOCOL propagation mechanism using
    on_set_protocol methods. Buffers can now be cleared after the SET_PROTOCOL command using clear_buffer methods.
 - Redesigned the idle report mechanism in HID. It now allows a callback function and handles multiple report IDs.
 - Added an option to send a ZLP on write with the same size as the endpoint in CDC ACM class using APP_USBD_CDC_ACM_ZLP_ON_EPSIZE_WRITE.
 - Implemented macros to set interval for individual endpoints. See APP_USBD_EP_WITH_INTERVAL.
 - Transfers in Audio class can now be started in SOF interrupt set in the app_usbd_audio_sof_interrupt_register function.
 
 
*** Changes
************
 
** BLE **
 - Increased the length of the advertising name for the Running Speed and Cadence sensor example (ble_app_rscs) to make it easy to verify
    that it is using the extended advertising.
 - Included the Scanning module into all BLE examples. This aligns how scanning is performed in these examples.
 - Updated the NFC pairing examples (ble_app_hids_keyboard_pairing_nfc, ble_app_hrs_nfc_pairing, ble_nfc_pairing_reference) to start using
    the LESC functionality in the Peer Manager (which uses the nrf_ble_lesc module).
 - Removed the manual handling of credits for the Object Transfer Service (ble_app_ots and ble_app_ots_c). Most use cases now work faster
    and simpler when the SoftDevice is controlling it.
 - Updated the API documentation for advertising_init in the Advertising module (ble_advertising). It was clarified that UUID arrays were not
    copied into the Advertising module.
 - Advertising module (ble_advertising) is no longer dependent on the fstorage module.
 - Changed the ANCS example (ble_app_ancs_c) so that it no longer performs service discovery after connecting to an already bonded peer.
 - Lowered the advertising interval in the Eddystone example (ble_app_eddystone), because some advertising packets would be lost when combined
    with the timeslot API.
 - Reduced the maximum supported value for advertising interval in Eddystone from 20000 to 16384. If a higher value is set, the SoftDevice returns
    an error code that asserts the application.
 - Peer Manager:
    - Various improvements to documentation.
    - The Peer Manager will now take less space for the same features.
    - To decrease complexity, the Peer Manager no longer uses the 'reserve' functionality in FDS, meaning that PM_EVT_STORAGE_FULL
      events will come slightly later if bonds cannot be stored during bonding.
    - Error event parameters now specify whether the error code is to be interpreted as an FDS_ error or an NRF_ error.
    - Peers without a stored rank are now never returned from pm_peer_ranks_get().
    - The function pm_peer_data_load() now fills the array even when returning NRF_ERROR_DATA_SIZE.
    - Enabled internal LESC key handling through PM_LESC_ENABLED. Function pm_lesc_public_key_set() is now deprecated because of this change.
 - All examples using the Peer Manager now use the new standard event handlers.
    While some examples implement custom behavior, all examples do the following:
    - Log Peer Manager events (at different log levels).
    - Encrypt immediately on connection with bonded peers.
    - Delete old bonds to make room for new peer data.
 - Some examples supporting central mode disconnect when link encryption fails. Look for functions calling pm_handler_disconnect_on_sec_failure().
 - The ble_app_bms example will now request for security procedure to be initiated if the Central does not initiate it.
 - Updated examples with directed advertisement to take into account Central Address Resolution value.
 
** IEEE 802.15.4 **
 - Updated the radio test example to support 802.15.4 radio modes.
 
** Crypto **
 - Updated documentation about RAM requirements on mbed TLS.
 - Added endianness change Curve25519 (to little endian).
 - Removed the following defines. A compile error is shown if they are enabled in a configuration:
    - NRF_CRYPTO_BACKEND_CC310_BL_HASH_LITTLE_ENDIAN_DIGEST_ENABLED
    - NRF_CRYPTO_BACKEND_CC310_BL_ECC_LITTLE_ENDIAN_ENABLED
    - NRF_CRYPTO_BACKEND_MICRO_ECC_LITTLE_ENDIAN_ENABLED
    - NRF_CRYPTO_BACKEND_NRF_SW_HASH_LITTLE_ENDIAN_DIGEST_ENABLED
 - nrf_crypto micro-ecc backend: Moved ECDH public key validation from the key convert function to ECDH compute
    (moved from nrf_crypto_backend_micro_ecc_public_key_from_raw to nrf_crypto_backend_micro_ecc_ecdh_compute).
 - Upgraded nrf_cc310 and nrf_cc310_bl to version 0.9.10 including minor changes to some default configurations.
 - Removed micro-ecc library/mbed TLS from BLE LESC examples for better user experience.
    - micro-ecc library prevented a working compilation in a fresh LESC example (requires external download).
    - mbed TLS significantly increases compilation time in the project, even if it is not configured as the enabled nrf_crypto backend.
 
** DFU and Bootloader **
 - Updated documentation about how to change the existing SDFU project, so that the application can be uploaded without signature verification,
    but at the same time to keep the signature verification when updating a SoftDevice and/or bootloader.
 - The bootloader now does not use app_timer, which saves flash space.
 - The bootloader now does the endian-conversion in code, instead of relying on endian-conversion in nrf_crypto.
 
** Drivers and libraries **
 - Changed the peripherals' default interrupt priority level from 7 to 6.
 - Included new version of nrfx (v1.1.0). For the nrfx changelog, see https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
 - nrf_log:
     - Updated to production quality.
     - You can now store/load the filtering configuration in FDS.
     - You can now control one backend from another.
 - nrf_cli: Added support for terminal meta keys.
 
** Proprietary **
 - Updated ESB library to support all current variants of nRF52. This mainly involves adding proper handling of Errata related to the radio.
 - Added a function to skip the next packet in the TX queue. This was previously a function used internally in the module under another name.
 
** USB **
 - Moved USBD strings configuration to sdk_config.
 - Rebuilt MSC class write procedure.
 - Moved APP_USBD_CONFIG_LOG_ENABLED to nrf_log settings.
 - HID report protocol is now default after reset.
 - HID default idle rate after reset can now be defined.
 - OUT transfers are now dropped when clearing stall on endpoint.
 - SET_ADDRESS command is now defined as a separate event in app_usbd. It does not change the state of the device anymore.
 - EP0 is now disabled until USB RESET condition is detected.
 - HID OUT reports are now limited to 63 bytes of data + 1 byte reserved for report ID.

 - Peer Manager:
    - Fixed a bug where the event PM_EVT_FLASH_GARBAGE_COLLECTED was also sent when garbage collection failed.
    - Fixed a bug in pm_next_peer_id_get() where it could report a peer with no data attached to it if used during bonding.
    - Fixed a bug where peer data would not be written because the internal retry mechanism failed after two attempts.
    - Fixed a bug where pairing (no bonding) could happen with an already bonded peer without triggering a PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_CONFIG_REQ event.
    - Fixed several documentation bugs related to error codes.
 - Eddystone:
    - Fixed a bug where the default TX power was set to 0 instead of using the DEFAULT_FRAME_TX_POWER define.
    - Fixed a bug where an invalid reference of a variable could cause incorrect data to be sent.
   
** IEEE 802.15.4 **
 - Adjusted CCA threshold value to be correct for nRF52840 Rev. 1 (different from what was available on the Engineering sample).
 - Implemented a fix for Anomaly 153 (temperature correction of RSSI measurement): added an API in RAL module for calculating the corrected RSSI value.
 
** Drivers and libraries **

** NFC **
 - Integrated fixes from EMVCo test suite (improved interoperability).
 - Added automatic fix for Anomaly 181.
 - Fixed a bug where HFCLK was requested too early for nRF52840 Rev. 1 chip.
 - Changed the way the fixes for chip errata are switched: use chip defines from MDK instead of board defines (simplifying usage of custom boards).
 
** USB **
 - Removed redundant barriers in USBD HAL.
 - Fixed a bug in HID library where the report descriptor was limited to 64 bytes.
 - Fixed a bug where USBD was not able to wake up after SOF event.
 - Fixed a bug where the SET_ADDRESS command was not processed in time.
 - USB application library (stack) now properly supports a situation when the HOST requests a descriptor but sets wLength Setup field to 0.
 
 
*** Known Issues
****************
 
** BLE **
 - Peer Manager:
    - When a link is already secured and the peer sends a slave security request for a higher level of security, the request will not be honored.
    - Service Changed indications might be silently dropped without being sent if the attempt to send them happens during an ATT MTU exchange.
    - Service Changed indications might be silently dropped if the flash is full when the Service Changed flag is being stored in flash.

** BLE IOT **
 - Neighbor discovery module for lwIP requires the on-link flag in the router advertisement to be set to create a SLAAC address from the prefix.
    However, RFC 7668 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7668) requires this bit to be zero. Therefore, the nd6.c from lwIP source has been modified
    to relax this check.
 - There are some issues when using the IoT examples against Linux Kernel 4.12+ that cause the kernel to only work with one 6LoWPAN connection.
    If more than one kit is connected using 6LoWPAN, none of the nodes will be accessible.
 - Scheduler has been included in most IoT examples to avoid race conditions found when using the lwIP stack, more precisely the TCP examples.
    The issue was that the TCP client would stop working after about 15 hours. However, when using mbed TLS, the use of scheduler is not possible.
    Therefore, the MQTT client examples might be affected by this issue.
 - The use of security, both with TLS and DTLS, should be treated as experimental.
 - MQTT examples cannot be used with commissioning on nRF52832. There is not enough RAM to accommodate both TLS and the commissioning service.
 - If enabled, RTT logs in IoT bootloader might not be printed before resetting.
 - The background_dfu example does not work.
 
** Drivers and libraries **
 - SAADC driver is not handling detection limits: high and low correctly if SAADC resolution is greater than 10 bits.
 - In the radio test example, modulated packets will only have the requested content in the first two bytes.
    Further bytes have random values.
 - In the radio test example, start_duty_cycle_modulated_tx is not working as intended.
    The actual duty cycle on air is not what was requested in the command.
  
** USBD **
 - Due to Anomaly 199, the USBD driver blocks code execution during EasyDMA transfer (for stability).
 - USBD BLE UART FreeRTOS example is not working when combined with Nordic UART Service Client example.

*****
Note for IAR 8 users:
(Libraries for IAR 8 require wchar_t to be of size 32 bits while IAR 7 requires 16 bits).

To run a project using IAR 8, follow these intructions:
 - Open the IAR project in IAR 8. The IAR workbench will automatically generate an IAR 8 compatible project file.
 - If the project contains one of the precompiled libraries listed below, replace it with the IAR 8 compatible alternative
   (there are no projects targeting nRF51 in this SDK).
 - Save the project.
 - When building the project, you might get the warning: "The header file 'cmsis_iar.h' is obsolete and should not be used. [...]".
	- The problem is described in DevZone post: https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/31123/iar-ewarm-8-22-1-complains-about-cmsis_iar-h
	  The solution is to remove all occurrences of #include <cmsis_iar.h>.
   
The affected libraries are:
 - micro-ecc crypto:
    - IAR7: Includes library located in the folder named “…_iar\…”.
    - IAR8: Switch to using the library from the folder named “…_armgcc\…”.

*** New features
***************** 

** BLE **
 - Added new targets to demonstrate the use of S112 on nRF52832 (PCA10040).
 - Added "Property Read" for the Object Transfer Service client (ble_app_ots_c).
 - Added a Scanning Module to simplify scanning for BLE devices in central role.
 - Peer Manager:
	- peer_manager_handler.h: There are now standard event handlers available to users of the Peer Manager.
       The event handlers provide features like logging, automatically securing the link, and automatically
       deleting the oldest bond if the flash is full.
    - PM_RA_PROTECTION_ENABLED: The Peer Manager can now be configured to reject repeated security requests
       from peers that failed pairing.
    - PM_LESC_ENABLED: Improved LESC support.
    - PM_LOG_ENABLED: Added error and warning level logging messages to the Peer Manager.
    - PM_EVT_FLASH_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_FAILED: Added new event.
 - Added LESC support to the following examples: ble_app_hrs, ble_app_hrs_c, and ble_app_gls.
 - Added support for nRF52840 (PCA10056) in the beacon example (ble_app_beacon).
 - Added Swift Pair support to the HID mouse example (ble_app_hids_mouse).
 - Battery Service: Added the possibility to notify a reconnected, bonded peer of an updated battery level.
    This feature is demonstrated in the Immediate Alert Server example.

** Crypto **
 - EdDSA: Added support for Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (Ed25519).
 - In documentation, added a table showing supported nrf_crypto backends for different examples:
    http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.1.0/nrf_crypto_default_backends.html
	
** DFU/Bootloader ** 
 - Added a new target to the SDFU example to demonstrate SDFU running on nRF52810 (PCA10040E). In a single bank update, there is only
    about 60 kB of flash available. This restricts what can be updated.
 - The bootloader settings page is now backed up before being updated. This increases protection from corruption caused by chance events
	(for example, power failure) and malicious apps.
 - The advertising interval of BLE DFU can now be configured in sdk_config (NRF_DFU_BLE_ADV_INTERVAL).
 - The size of the application data area that is left alone by the bootloader can now be configured
    in sdk_config (NRF_DFU_APP_DATA_AREA_SIZE).
 - The bootloader code now supports most of nrf_crypto backends. However, the size of the binary will likely be too large if other backends
    are used, so you will need to accomodate by increasing the size of the bootloader.

** USB **
 - Added response/no response to an IN token on ISO IN endpoint with a ZLP when no data is ready. This can be set with USBD_CONFIG_ISO_IN_ZLP.
 - Added support for configuration string ID.
 - Added an option to give priority to isochronous transfers using USBD_CONFIG_DMASCHEDULER_ISO_BOOST.
 - Implemented SOF event callback in interrupt for classes.
 - Added an enum and get function for a selected protocol (boot or report) in HID. Implemented a SET_PROTOCOL propagation mechanism using
	on_set_protocol methods. Buffers can now be cleared after the SET_PROTOCOL command using clear_buffer methods.
 - Redesigned the idle report mechanism in HID. It now allows a callback function and handles multiple report IDs.
 - Added an option to send a ZLP on write with the same size as the endpoint in CDC ACM class using APP_USBD_CDC_ACM_ZLP_ON_EPSIZE_WRITE.
 - Implemented macros to set interval for individual endpoints. See APP_USBD_EP_WITH_INTERVAL.
 - Transfers in Audio class can now be started in SOF interrupt set in the app_usbd_audio_sof_interrupt_register function.


*** Changes
************

** BLE **
 - Increased the length of the advertising name for the Running Speed and Cadence sensor example (ble_app_rscs) to make it easy to verify
	that it is using the extended advertising.
 - Included the Scanning module into all BLE examples. This aligns how scanning is performed in these examples.
 - Updated the NFC pairing examples (ble_app_hids_keyboard_pairing_nfc, ble_app_hrs_nfc_pairing, ble_nfc_pairing_reference) to start using
	the LESC functionality in the Peer Manager (which uses the nrf_ble_lesc module).
 - Removed the manual handling of credits for the Object Transfer Service (ble_app_ots and ble_app_ots_c). Most use cases now work faster
	and simpler when the SoftDevice is controlling it.
 - Updated the API documentation for advertising_init in the Advertising module (ble_advertising). It was clarified that UUID arrays were not
	copied into the Advertising module.
 - Advertising module (ble_advertising) is no longer dependent on the fstorage module.
 - Changed the ANCS example (ble_app_ancs_c) so that it no longer performs service discovery after connecting to an already bonded peer.
 - Lowered the advertising interval in the Eddystone example (ble_app_eddystone), because some advertising packets would be lost when combined
	with the timeslot API.
 - Reduced the maximum supported value for advertising interval in Eddystone from 20000 to 16384. If a higher value is set, the SoftDevice returns
	an error code that asserts the application.
 - Peer Manager:
	- Various improvements to documentation.
	- The Peer Manager will now take less space for the same features.
	- To decrease complexity, the Peer Manager no longer uses the 'reserve' functionality in FDS, meaning that PM_EVT_STORAGE_FULL
      events will come slightly later if bonds cannot be stored during bonding.
	- Error event parameters now specify whether the error code is to be interpreted as an FDS_ error or an NRF_ error.
	- Peers without a stored rank are now never returned from pm_peer_ranks_get().
	- The function pm_peer_data_load() now fills the array even when returning NRF_ERROR_DATA_SIZE.
	- Enabled internal LESC key handling through PM_LESC_ENABLED. Function pm_lesc_public_key_set() is now deprecated because of this change.
 - All examples using the Peer Manager now use the new standard event handlers.
    While some examples implement custom behavior, all examples do the following:
    - Log Peer Manager events (at different log levels).
    - Encrypt immediately on connection with bonded peers.
    - Delete old bonds to make room for new peer data.
 - Some examples supporting central mode disconnect when link encryption fails. Look for functions calling pm_handler_disconnect_on_sec_failure().
 - The ble_app_bms example will now request for security procedure to be initiated if the Central does not initiate it.

** IEEE 802.15.4 **
 - Updated the radio test example to support 802.15.4 radio modes.

** Crypto **
 - Updated documentation about RAM requirements on mbed TLS.
 - Added endianness change Curve25519 (to little endian).
 - Removed the following defines. A compile error is shown if they are enabled in a configuration:
	- NRF_CRYPTO_BACKEND_CC310_BL_HASH_LITTLE_ENDIAN_DIGEST_ENABLED
	- NRF_CRYPTO_BACKEND_CC310_BL_ECC_LITTLE_ENDIAN_ENABLED
	- NRF_CRYPTO_BACKEND_MICRO_ECC_LITTLE_ENDIAN_ENABLED
	- NRF_CRYPTO_BACKEND_NRF_SW_HASH_LITTLE_ENDIAN_DIGEST_ENABLED
 - nrf_crypto micro-ecc backend: Moved ECDH public key validation from the key convert function to ECDH compute
	(moved from nrf_crypto_backend_micro_ecc_public_key_from_raw to nrf_crypto_backend_micro_ecc_ecdh_compute).
 - Upgraded nrf_cc310 and nrf_cc310_bl to version 0.9.10 including minor changes to some default configurations.

** DFU and Bootloader **
 - Updated documentation about how to change the existing SDFU project, so that the application can be uploaded without signature verification,
	but at the same time to keep the signature verification when updating a SoftDevice and/or bootloader.
 - The bootloader now does not use app_timer, which saves flash space.
 - The bootloader now does the endian-conversion in code, instead of relying on endian-conversion in nrf_crypto.

** Drivers and libraries **
 - Included new version of nrfx (v1.1.0). For the nrfx changelog, see https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
 - nrf_log: 
     - Updated to production quality.
     - You can now store/load the filtering configuration in FDS.
	 - You can now control one backend from another.
 - nrf_cli: Added support for terminal meta keys.

** Proprietary **
 - Updated ESB library to support all current variants of nRF52. This mainly involves adding proper handling of Errata related to the radio.
 - Added a function to skip the next packet in the TX queue. This was previously a function used internally in the module under another name.

** USB **
 - Moved USBD strings configuration to sdk_config.
 - Rebuilt MSC class write procedure.
 - Moved APP_USBD_CONFIG_LOG_ENABLED to nrf_log settings.
 - HID report protocol is now default after reset.
 - HID default idle rate after reset can now be defined.
 - OUT transfers are now dropped when clearing stall on endpoint.
 - SET_ADDRESS command is now defined as a separate event in app_usbd. It does not change the state of the device anymore.
 - EP0 is now disabled until USB RESET condition is detected.
 - HID OUT reports are now limited to 63 bytes of data + 1 byte reserved for report ID.


*** Bug fixes
****************

** BLE **
 - Fixed a bug in the BLE UART client (ble_app_uart_c) where it would check the wrong error code when issuing multiple write commands.
 - Fixed a bug in the Eddystone example (ble_app_eddystone) where the default TX power was set to 0 directly
	instead of using the DEFAULT_FRAME_TX_POWER define.
 - Fixed a bug in the ANCS example (ble_app_ancs) where app_timer was included too many times.
 - Fixed a bug in the Advertising module (ble_advertising) where a comment referred to seconds instead of 10 ms.
 - Fixed a bug in the LESC connection example (ble_app_multirole_lesc) where the procedure for connection parameter update would not be started
	immediately upon connection.
 - Fixed a bug where a precompiled hex was missing for Immediate Alert Server (ble_app_ias) and Service Changed server (ble_app_gatts) examples.
 - Fixed a bug in the Radio Notification Event Handler (ble_radio_notification) where a missing include stopped it from compiling.
 - Fixed a bug in the BLE Interactive Command Line Interface Example in service discovery procedure.
 - Fixed a bug in the Alert Notification Service, where it was not possible to enable notifications for an unread alert.
 - Peer Manager:
    - Fixed a bug where the event PM_EVT_FLASH_GARBAGE_COLLECTED was also sent when garbage collection failed.
    - Fixed a bug in pm_next_peer_id_get() where it could report a peer with no data attached to it if used during bonding.
	- Fixed a bug where peer data would not be written because the internal retry mechanism failed after two attempts.
    - Fixed several documentation bugs related to error codes.
  
** IEEE 802.15.4 **
 - Adjusted CCA threshold value to be correct for nRF52840 Rev. 1 (different from what was available on the Engineering sample).
 - Implemented a fix for Anomaly 153 (temperature correction of RSSI measurement): added an API in RAL module for calculating the corrected RSSI value.

** Drivers and libraries **
 - Fixed a bug in the SPI manager where app_timer was included too many times.
 - Fixed a wrapping issue in the Ring Buffer library.

** DTM **
 - Added support for 8 dB on nRF52840 targets.
 - Implemented the workaround for nRF52840 Anomaly 172 which caused the device to fail a test with interference in co-channels (RF-PHY/RCV/BV-29-C).

** Proprietary **
 - Fixed a bug in bytewise_bit_swap where it was harder to backport the implementation to nRF51.
 - Fixed a bug in nrf_esb_pop_tx where the packet queue would occasionally be corrupted.
 - Added shutdown of the system timer as the workaround for Anomaly 78 and to save energy.

** NFC **
 - Integrated fixes from EMVCo test suite (improved interoperability).
 - Added automatic fix for Anomaly 181.
 - Fixed a bug where HFCLK was requested too early for nRF52840 Rev. 1 chip.
 - Changed the way the fixes for chip errata are switched: use chip defines from MDK instead of board defines (simplifying usage of custom boards).

** USB **
 - Removed redundant barriers in USBD HAL.
 - Fixed a bug in HID library where the report descriptor was limited to 64 bytes.
 - Fixed a bug where USBD was not able to wake up after SOF event.
 - Fixed a bug where the SET_ADDRESS command was not processed in time.


*** Known Issues
****************

** BLE **
 - Peer Manager:
	- When a link is already secured and the peer sends a slave security request for a higher level of security, the request will not be honored.
	- Service Changed indications might be silently dropped without being sent if the attempt to send them happens during an ATT MTU exchange. 

** BLE IOT **
 - Neighbor discovery module for lwIP requires the on-link flag in the router advertisement to be set to create a SLAAC address from the prefix.
	However, RFC 7668 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7668) requires this bit to be zero. Therefore, the nd6.c from lwIP source has been modified
	to relax this check.
 - There are some issues when using the IoT examples against Linux Kernel 4.12+ that cause the kernel to only work with one 6LoWPAN connection.
	If more than one kit is connected using 6LoWPAN, none of the nodes will be accessible.
 - Scheduler has been included in most IoT examples to avoid race conditions found when using the lwIP stack, more precisely the TCP examples.
	The issue was that the TCP client would stop working after about 15 hours. However, when using mbed TLS, the use of scheduler is not possible.
	Therefore, the MQTT client examples might be affected by this issue.
 - The use of security, both with TLS and DTLS, should be treated as experimental.
 - MQTT examples cannot be used with commissioning on nRF52832. There is not enough RAM to accommodate both TLS and the commissioning service.
 - If enabled, RTT logs in IoT bootloader might not be printed before resetting.
 - The background_dfu example does not work.

** Drivers and libraries **
 - SAADC driver is not handling detection limits: high and low correctly if SAADC resolution is greater than 10 bits.
 - In the radio test example, modulated packets will only have the requested content in the first two bytes.
    Further bytes have random values.
 - In the radio test example, start_duty_cycle_modulated_tx is not working as intended.
    The actual duty cycle on air is not what was requested in the command.
 
** USBD **
 - Due to Anomaly 199, the USBD driver blocks code execution during EasyDMA transfer (for stability).

 - SoftDevice independence:
     - Only the BLE bootloader is now dependent on the SoftDevice. The others depend only on the MBR (which is now part of the SDK).
     - The DFU now supports updating applications that do not use the SoftDevice. Such an application must be compiled to be placed above the MBR.
 - The DFU protocol has been extended to support new messages:
     - Protocol version - To retrieve information about the protocol version.
     - Firmware version - To retrieve information (size, version) about each piece of firmware on the chip.
     - Hardware version - To retrieve information (flash/RAM size, page size) about the hardware.
     - DFU Abort - To instruct the bootloader to abort the DFU procedure and reset the device.
 - Configurable security: New configuration parameters to turn on and off version checking and signature checking of application transfers. Added a new example using the new configurations (open_bootloader).
 - DFU Trigger (USB): Added a library to allow DFU mode to be triggered through USB in the application. The library is used in the new ble_connectivity example that uses USB CDC ACM.
 - Added optional skipping of application CRC check. CRC check can be skipped on wakeup from System Off or on special value written to GPREGRET2 register.
 - Added watchdog support to the bootloader. If application had enabled watchdog before resetting to the bootloader, it is fed in the bootloader.

 - Added new logger backends for writing logs to flash: flashlog backend for storing logs in standard operation, crashlog backend for dumping logs on error condition. Added CLI commands for controlling data stored in flash.
 - Added optional timestamp formatting in the logger.  
 - Added new implementation of app_timer (libraries/timer/experimental/app_timer2.c) which does not use SWI, uses less RAM and flash, and has modular, simpler design. It shares the same API as the legacy implementation. The new implementation is used by bootloaders and peripheral/CLI.
 - Added bsp_cli module to send BSP events through CLI.
 - Added nrf_atflags module for atomic manipulation of bit fields.
 - Added improved CLI UART backend called libUARTE. This backend is recommended when the CLI must exchange big amounts of data fast, for example when CLI is used with a script.
 
** Serialization **
 - Added serialization of the S112, S132, and S140 v6.0.0 SoftDevices.
 - Added serialization connectivity application for PCA10059 using USB CDC ACM as the transport layer.
 
** USB **
 - Added example with the SoftDevice and USB (usbd_ble_uart).
 - Added configuration of the self-powered descriptor bit (APP_USBD_CONFIG_SELF_POWERED).
 - Added buffering of transfers in CDC.
 - Added configuration of power in a descriptor (APP_USBD_CONFIG_MAX_POWER).
 - Added option to specify the CDC ACM protocol.
 - Added dummy interface class.
 - Implemented USBD power event processing in app_usbd event queue.
 - Implemented different ways of processing SOF events:
    - Normal - SOF events are pushed normally into the event queue.
    - Compress - SOF events are counted and bound with other events or executed when the queue is empty. This prevents the queue from filling up with SOF events.
    - Interrupt - SOF events are processed in the interrupt.
 - Implemented Get Output Report in HID class.
 - New SoftDevice API used for USB power events.
 - Button events can now be sent through CLI in the usbd_cdc_acm, usbd_hid_composide, and usbd_hid generic examples.
 
 
*** Changes
************
 
** ANT **
 - Added welcome message to all ANT examples. Logging is enabled by default in all of them.
 - Removed obsolete module: ant_stack_config. The ANT SoftDevice Handler module has taken over its functionality.
 
** BLE **
 - Minor improvements to consistency of BLE examples main functions (comments, function call ordering, function names).
 - BLE examples changed to use the Queued Write module (nrf_ble_qwr). Applications must explicitly configure characteristics to accept long writes. See app_ble_qwr for an example of this. This fixes a problem where peers could cause our devices to assert by issuing long writes.
 - BLE examples changed to use the Power Management library. Most examples now call nrf_pwr_mgmt_run() instead of sd_app_evt_wait().
 - Eddystone modules have been moved from components/libraries to components/ble.
 - ble_app_uart changed to have 247-byte MTU, up from 64.
 - Peer Manager:
     - The members of pm_conn_sec_procedure_t have been renamed from PM_LINK_SECURED_PROCEDURE_* to PM_CONN_SEC_PROCEDURE_*.
     - The following functions have gained new error codes:
         - pm_conn_secure()
         - pm_peer_data_store()
         - pm_peer_ranks_get()
         - pm_peer_rank_highest()
 
** BLE IOT **
 - Minor updates in TFTP background DFU modules to align with changed DFU libraries.
 
** Crypto **
 - nrf_crypto APIs have been changed to use big-endian only.
    - Previous versions of nrf_crypto used little-endian ordering to conform to BLE requirements in LESC.
      This has now been changed to big-endian everywhere. There are conversion functions available to 
      change between little-endian and big-endian input/output. 
    - See the Migration Guide for details.
 - nrf_crypto memory management has changed extensively. 
    - See the Migration Guide for details.
 - nrf_crypto configuration of frontends and backends is now primarily done through sdk_config.h.
    - See the Migration Guide for details.
 
** DFU/Bootloader **
 - Configuration parameters (sdk_config) have changed. See the Migration Guide for details.
 - Refactoring: The DFU/bootloader code has been extensively refactored.
     - The split between DFU and bootloader has been improved.
        - New events from DFU.
        - Resetting has been moved from DFU to bootloader, based on DFU events.
        - Much of the code in nrf_dfu_utils has been extracted into the new nrf_bootloader_fw_activation and nrf_bootloader_dfu_timers modules.
     - Request handling module:
        - The dfu_req_handling module has been renamed to nrf_dfu_req_handler and moved to components/libraries/bootloader/dfu.
        - The request handling now uses app_scheduler and is entirely asynchronous and executed in the main context.
        - The init command validation was refactored out and into two new modules nrf_dfu_validation and nrf_dfu_ver_validation.
     - The Serial transport is now called UART.
     - The shared parts of the USB and UART transports have been placed in a separate module nrf_dfu_serial.
     - Most of the assembly code in bootloader_app_start has been replaced with C code and extracted into a separate file nrf_bootloader_app_start_final.
     - Examples:
        - The secure bootloader examples have been moved into a 'secure_bootloader' folder.
        - The experimental ANT bootloader has been moved into an 'experimental' folder.
        - The USB secure bootloader is no longer experimental.
 - Bootloader examples have been reorganized. Examples "bootloader_secure_ble", "bootloader_secure_serial", and "experimental_bootloader_secure_usb" have been merged into "secure_bootloader" with projects for each transport and board.
 - Write protection of the bootloader: Before booting the app, the bootloader will write-protect the flash areas of the bootloader and MBR (using BPROT on nRF52832/nRF52810 and ACL on nRF52840).
     - The BLE Buttonless SVCI interface needs access to the bootloader settings page from the application, so there is a new configuration parameter to specify whether that page should be part of the protection.
     - The SVCI interface will now return NRF_ERROR_FORBIDDEN if using the interface when the page is protected.
 - WDT compatibility: The bootloader will feed the WDT if the app has started it.
 - BLE DFU:
     - The BLE DFU bootloader now explicitly requests the preferred connection interval upon connection. The minimum and maximum connection intervals can be set in sdk_config.h.
     - The BLE DFU bootloader will use long ATT MTUs and data length extension when the host supports these features. This increases DFU transfer speed considerably.
     - Several stability improvements over different transport configurations.
 - USB serial number: The serial number of the USB bootloaders has changed to be the same as the default BLE address (found under DEVICEADDR in FICR).
 - New crypto backend for nRF52840: The bootloaders for nRF52840 use the hardware crypto backend (CC310) instead of micro-ecc.
 
** Drivers and libraries **
 - The way peripheral drivers are handled in the SDK has been reorganized:
     - Replaced existing drivers with the "external" drivers from nrfx project. See https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/blob/master/README.md for more information on nrfx.
     - New drivers from nrfx are located in "..\modules\nrfx".
     - Drivers replaced by nrfx are removed from "..\components\driver_nrf".
     - A glue layer is added to make the nrfx driver compatible with SDK and the SoftDevice.
 - Refactored I2S driver.
 - New reliable delay implementation.
 - Added CLI commands to nrf_balloc and nrf_queue which print out the status of all instances present in the system.
 - CLI built-in root commands: cli_stats, colors, and echo have been changed to subcommands: cli colors, cli echo, and cli stats.
 - The CMSIS-SVD files with device descriptions have been moved from the "..\svd" folder to the "..\modules\nrfx\mdk" folder.
 - Infineon OPTIGA: 
     - Replaced "crypto\ifx_optiga_auth" example with the new one: "crypto\ifx_optiga_ecdsa_simple".
     - Updated related libraries from the "external\infineon" directory.
     - Replaced support for Infineon OPTIGA Trust E HSM with Infineon OPTIGA Trust X HSM.
     - Added support for IAR toolchain.
 
** Proprietary **
 - New Gazell functionalities:
     - Transmission statistics gathering - counts successful packet transactions and timeouts on each of the RF channels.
     - External analog frontend module control - generates TX/RX signals during transmission/receiving, which can be used to control the external PA/LNA module.
 - Updated gzll_ack_payload examples with the example usage of the new Gazell features.
 - Dynamic changes of TX attempts and TX power parameters are now allowed when the Gazell stack is enabled.
 - Removed the nRF52840 project from ble_app_gzll example (removed "pca10056" folder).
 
** NFC **
 - Type 2 Tag Library:
    - Modified Dynamic Memory structure of the Tag. Added Terminator TLV to indicate that there is no more relevant user data after NDEF TLV.
 - Type 4 Tag HAL:
    - Modified Frame Wait Time setting to support full range available on the nRF52840 Rev. 1 chip.
 - Type 4 Tag Library:
    - Modified behavior of the NFC_T4T_EVENT_NDEF_READ event: the event is always triggered when the last byte of the NDEF File is sent to an NFC Reader device - even if the Reader repeats the read operation multiple times in one session, i.e. before the Reader sends a DESELECT or SLP_REQ frame.
 - NFC BLE pairing library: modified to support multiple connections.
 - BLE/NFC examples: updated application behavior to comply with NFC Forum user experience recommendations.
 - NFC libraries which can enable nrf_log independently (using sdk_config.h) register the logger instance conditionally, i.e. only if nrf_log is enabled in the sdk_config.h
 
** USB **
 - app_usbd_init: when called with NULL configuration structure or NULL ev_handler member of a structure, the default event handler will be used.
 - app_usbd_init: removed clock initialization.
 - Descriptors are now generated on the fly using simple stackless thread code.
 - Added a warning for wrong interface order.
 - Combined USB CDC ACM driver for all examples into one.
 
   
*** Bugfixes
****************
 
** ANT **
 - Added missing logger backends to all examples.
 
** BLE **
  - Fixed a bug in ble_app_uart where Data Length update requests would be handled twice.
  - Fixed a bug in ble_app_uart and ble_app_uart_c where the "start" message in the main function was not followed by a line feed. This could make the applications seem unresponsive.
  - Fixed a bug in ble_app_cgms where properties of the characteristics were not configured.
  - Fixed a bug in ble_app_cgms where directed advertising was enabled by the advertising module but was ignored by the application. Directed advertising is now disabled.
  - Fixed a bug in ble_app_cgms where advertising was triggered twice when deleting bonds. The second call to advertising start would cause the example to assert on the busy error.
  - Fixed a bug in ble_app_gls  where the seconds field of the glucose measurement was never updated.
  - Fixed a bug in ble_tps where documentation for ble_tps_tx_power_level_set() was describing another unrelated function.
  - Fixed a bug in most main.c files where fds garbage collection fds_gc() would retry upon returning FDS_ERR_BUSY. However, this function call will never return FDS_ERR_BUSY.
  - Fixed a bug in nrf_ble_gatts_c where setting NRF_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL to debug (4) would cause an assert because it was not registered with the logger module (NRF_LOG_MODULE_REGISTER();)
  - Added missing Errata workaround to Direct Test Mode (DTM) on nRF52840.
  - Peer Manager:
      - Fixed the bonded flag in pm_conn_sec_status_get().
      - Fixed a performance bug in peer_database.c.
      - Split the error code NRF_ERROR_INVALID_STATE from pm_conn_secure() that could have two different meanings.
 
** BLE IOT **
  - Corrected logging module name, such that logs could be enabled in the LWIP platform module.
  - Fixed a reassembly bug in BSD socket module.
  - Fixed flushing of ports when the kit disconnects. Added API to flush the ports.
  - Added handling of BLE_L2CAP_EVT_CH_SDU_BUF_RELEASED event to generate the BLE_IPSP_EVT_CHANNEL_DATA_TX_COMPLETE in case link disconnection occured before the TX was complete.
  - Resolved an issue with MQTT/lwIP packets stuck in a TX queue. Now forcing out enqueued data before close.
  - Conformed to MQTT specification in the use of QoS flag in MQTT connect.
 
** DFU/Bootloader **
  - Bootloaders for nRF52840 now support bootloader updates (if used with the new MBR or SoftDevice).
  
** Drivers and libraries **
  - Extended input pin configuration in the GPIOTE driver: configuration of GPIOTE INPUT pin added, which does not change the current GPIO configuration.
  - CLI module - fixed echo command behavior. When echo is off, the command will not be printed after log print.
  - Logger modules - stability fixes (including https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/31178/bug-nrf_log_frontend-m_log_data-buffer-overflow).
  - More changes in drivers can be found in the modules/nrfx directory in the CHANGELOG.md file.

** Proprietary **
 - Gazell stack:
    - Fixed a bug with high current consumption in disabled state, related with TIMER issue 78.
    - Fixed a bug with reenabling Gazell stack after the SoftDevice activity.
 - Gazell Pairing Library:
    - Fixed a bug with unreserved flash memory region for the Host ID.
    - Fixed a bug with wrong initialization of database flash memory page on nRF52 chips.
 
** NFC **
 - Type 2 Tag Library:
    - Modified Dynamic Memory content of the Tag. Dynamic Lock Bytes use proper values now.
    - Updated CC1 byte setting (one of the Type 2 Tag Reserved bytes) according to the new NFC Forum Type 2 Tag Technical Specification v1.0.
 - Type 2 Tag HAL:
    - Handling of erroneous NFC-A data frames (with parity and CRC errors) has been improved. 

** USB **
 - Fixed a bug in USB CDC ACM class where the APP_USBD_CDC_ACM_USER_EVT_PORT_OPEN event was not raised.
 - Fixed a bug in USB CDC ACM class where RX stopped working after the port was closed or the cable was detached.
 - Fixed a bug in USB MSC where it could not satisfy the number of required bytes by the host.
 - Fixed a bug in app_usbd.c where APP_USBD_EVT_DRV_RESUME event was raised after a reset instead of APP_USBD_EVT_DRV_RESET.
 - Fixed a bug in HID class where Remote Wake Up was not properly handled.
 - Fixed a bug in nrf_drv_usbd_transfer_out_drop() where it was clearing an isochronous endpoint.
 - Fixed a bug in app_usbd_core.c where transfer status was not checked during EP0 processing.
 - FTPAN-171 workaround has been implemented.
 - FTPAN-199 workaround has been implemented.
 - Fixed minor issues.
 

*** Known Issues
****************
 
** Missing feature on nRF52840 **
  - ANT protocol support is missing due to ANT SoftDevices not available for this device.
  - FreeRTOS
  - ESB
 
** BLE **
 - BLE LESC module should be treated as experimental, even though it has not been marked as such.
 - Eddystone example should be treated as experimental on nRF52840. 
 
** BLE IOT **
 - Neighbor discovery module for lwIP requires the on-link flag in the 
   router advertisement to be set in order to create a SLAAC address 
   from the prefix. However, RFC 7668 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7668) 
   requires this bit to be zero. Therefore, the nd6.c from lwIP source 
   has been modified to relax this check.
 - There are some issues when using the IoT examples against Linux 
   Kernel 4.12+ which causes the kernel to only work with one 6LoWPAN 
   connection. If more than one kit is connected using 6LoWPAN, none of 
   the nodes will be accessible.
 - Scheduler has been included in most IoT examples to avoid race 
   conditions found when using the lwIP stack, more precisely the TCP 
   examples.
   The issue was that the TCP client stopped working after about 15
   hours. However, when using mbed TLS, the use of scheduler is not 
   possible.
   Therefore, the MQTT client examples might be affected by this issue.
 - The use of security, both with TLS and DTLS, should be treated as 
   experimental.
 - MQTT examples cannot be used with commissioning on nRF52832. There is not enough
   RAM to accommodate both TLS and the commissioning service.
 - If enabled, RTT logs in IoT bootloader might not be printed before resetting.
 
** DFU/Bootloader **
 - Changing the backend for nrf_crypto in sdk_config.h alone is not sufficient
   because the relevant files are not included in the build and include paths.
   See the Migration Guide for a walkthrough of changing from the µECC to the
   Oberon backend.
 - ble_app_buttonless_dfu will silently hang during bootup if a compatible
   bootloader, i.e. the BLE bootloader, is not present.
 - SES will not detect whether the debug bootloader is too large, instead it will place the code in the MBR params page. To make SES detect this, add the following line in flash_placement.xml:
   <ProgramSection load="no" name=".reserved_flash_tail" start="$(FLASH_START)+$(FLASH_SIZE)" size="$(FLASH_PH_SIZE)-$(FLASH_START)-$(FLASH_SIZE)" />
   Place this line immediately after:
   <ProgramSection alignment="4" load="Yes" runin=".tdata_run" name=".tdata" />
   The production bootloader is not affected by this issue.
 - nrfutil version 3.5.0  has an optional argument to increase the time delay "--connect-delay <seconds>". 
   It is recommended to set this value to 10 when Serial DFU (UART / USB) is performed for large images (SoftDevice + Application or SoftDevice + Bootloader + Application). 
 - You may experience some instability with the µECC library in IAR due to faulty decoding of symbol information. Compile the µECC library without symbol information to fix these issues.
   
** Proprietary **
 - Gazell stack for all devices is working with sensitivity reduced by 3 dB due to the RADIO issues 102, 106, 107, and 143. 
 
** NFC **
 - NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER 4 on nRF52840 and nRF52832 chips.
 
** USBD **
 - For the sake of stability, the USBD driver blocks code execution during EasyDMA transfer.
 - Isochronous transfers must be processed as fast as possible, but using the event queue may postpone SOF processing too long if the CPU is busy. In such situations, isochronous transfers should be started inside a SOF interrupt. Configure APP_USBD_CONFIG_SOF_HANDLING_MODE as interrupt. The implementation of special SOF interrupt callbacks is subject of the future updates.
 
** Drivers and Libraries **
 - SAADC driver is not handling detection limits: high and low correctly if SAADC resolution is greater than 10 bits.
 - The following examples do not have Keil 4 support: nrf_cc310, nrf_cc310_bl, ifx_optiga_ecdsa_simple.

========================================================================

nRF5 SDK v14.2.0
------------------------
Release Date: Week 46, 2017

Highlights:

- Support for the new S112 SoftDevice v5.1.0.
  
The following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and
verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM version 5.18a
- GCC: GCC ARM Embedded 4.9 2015q3
- IAR: IAR Workbench 7.80.4
- SES: SES 3.30
- Linux: Ubuntu 17.04, Kernel 4.10.0.
- Jlink: 6.20d
    
Supported SoftDevices:
- S112 v5.1.x
- S132 v5.0.x (for v5.1.x, see the note below)
- S140 v5.0.0-2.alpha
- S212 v5.0.x
- S332 v5.0.x

S132 compatibility:
The newly released S132 SoftDevice v5.1.0 is drop-in compatible with 
S132 v5.0.0, which is included in this SDK release. 
However, there are some limitations that you must be aware of when 
replacing the included SoftDevice with the new one:
- In S132 v5.1.0, the SoftDevice RAM usage is reduced. Examples that are
  optimized on RAM usage return a warning that the application RAM start
  address can be lowered. The examples work as before but are not fully 
  optimized on RAM usage.
- The test images in examples\dfu\secure_dfu_test_images are tightly
  connected with the precompiled HEX files located in 
  examples\dfu\bootloader_secure_ble\hex. Therefore, they cannot be used
  in combination with the new SoftDevice.
     
Supported boards:
- PCA10040E (nRF52810 emulation on PCA10040)
- PCA10040
- PCA10056 (limited support; see the "Scope for the nRF52840 chip" section)
- Dynastream's D52DK1 (only for ANT examples)
     
For other devices and boards, see the SDK documentation, section "Using
the SDK with other boards".
     
     
*** Scope for the nRF52840 chip
********************************
All examples and libraries for the new chip must be treated as
experimental.
Some examples have not been ported to run on nRF52840. Check the
existing example projects to see which targets are supported.
     
The following SDK features are supported on the new nRF52840 chip:
  - IEEE 802.15.4 stack library with an example
  - Most BLE, hardware peripheral, and NFC examples (with some
    exceptions; see the available example projects for details)
  - Peripheral HAL and drivers (both for existing and new peripherals)
  - Cryptography library including CryptoCell CC310 backend
  - NFC Type 2 Tag and Type 4 Tag

   - ESB
   - FreeRTOS
   - IoT components
   - Serialization of the S140 SoftDevice v5.0.0-2.alpha    
        
*** New features
*****************
 
** BLE **
 - Added support for the S112 SoftDevice v5.1.0.
 
** Crypto **
 - Added a makefile for compiling the micro-ecc library with a "soft" 
   FPU ABI (required for nRF52810, which does not have hardware FPU 
   support).
  
** Drivers and libraries **
 - Added support for a "soft" FPU ABI in the Task Manager library 
  (required for nRF52810, which does not have hardware FPU support).
   
*** Changes
************
 
** Drivers and libraries **
 - TWI Transaction Manager: Added support for passing the TWI 
   configuration in function nrf_twi_mngr_perform(). Pass NULL if you do
   not want to use this new feature.
 - Command Line Interface: Added support for commands longer than 255 
   characters.
 
   
*** Bugfixes
****************
  
** Drivers and libraries **
 - Fixed "echo" command behavior in nrf_cli.
 - Fixed a bug in nrf_ringbuf where allocation protection failed on a 
   second attempt to allocate a buffer in use.
 - Fixed a compile error in the Task Manager library when stack guard is
   off.
 - Fixed invalid module names in logger output when LTO was used in the 
   GCC compiler.
 - Fixed a bug in the logger where output could get corrupted when 
   logging was interrupted by NRF_LOG_PROCESS() (for example, flushing 
   in error handler).
 
** DTM **
 - Fixed a bug preventing certain TX power values to be set.
 - Set the PDU header payload type field of coded PHY 0xFF packets to 
   0x04 instead of 0x03 to make the 0xFF packets valid.

*** Known Issues
****************

** BLE **
 - When working on the emulated nRF52810 target, if you change the 
   optimization level and/or add the logging functionality, the project
   might not compile or fail at runtime due to not enough flash 
   available for FDS or Peer Manager.
 - All Bluetooth applications not using the nrf_queued_write module will
   assert when a peer sends a Write request with the opcode 'cancel all 
   operations' (BLE_GATTS_OP_EXEC_WRITE_REQ_CANCEL), after the 
   SoftDevice call to sd_ble_gatts_rw_authorize_reply. This SoftDevice 
   call, for the opcode 'cancel all operations', returns 
   NRF_INVALID_PARAMS if the gatt_status is not BLE_GATT_STATUS_SUCCESS.

** BLE IOT **
 - Neighbor discovery module for lwIP requires the on-link flag in the 
   router advertisement to be set in order to create a SLAAC address 
   from the prefix. However, RFC 7668 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7668) 
   requires this bit to be zero. Therefore, the nd6.c from lwIP source 
   has been modified to relax this check.
 - There are some issues when using the IoT examples against Linux 
   Kernel 4.12+ which causes the kernel to only work with one 6LoWPAN 
   connection. If more than one kit is connected using 6LoWPAN, none of 
   the nodes will be accessible.
 - Scheduler has been included in most IoT examples to avoid race 
   conditions found when using lwIP stack, more precisely the TCP 
   examples.
   The issue was that the TCP client stopped working after about 15 
   hours. However, when using mbedTLS, the use of scheduler is not 
   possible.
   Therefore, the MQTT client examples might be affected by this issue.
 - The use of security, both with TLS and DTLS, should be treated as 
   experimental.
 - MQTT examples cannot be used with commissioning. There is not enough
   RAM to accommodate both TLS and the commissioning service.

** NFC **
 - NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER 4 on 
   nRF52832.
 - Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag ("NFC Tools" and 
   "TagWriter" v4.1 seem to be okay to use).

** USB (experimental) **
 - MSC implementation does not stall when the host requires more bytes 
   than are available in the selected descriptor. It is not a problem 
   for any tested driver on Windows and Linux, but still violates the
   specification.
 - During high USB traffic, in rare cases, communication might hang or 
   the endpoint data might be transferred twice. See PAN 104.

** Drivers and libraries **
 - SAADC driver is not handling detection limits 'high' and 'low' 
   correctly if SAADC resolution is greater than 10 bits.

*** Scope for the nRF52840 chip
********************************
All examples and libraries for the new chip must be treated as
experimental.
Some examples have not been ported to run on nRF52840. Check the
existing example projects to see which targets are supported.

 - New example flash_fstorage added to examples\peripheral\flash_fstorage.
   This example shows how to use the nrf_fstorage library.
 - New example flash_fds added to examples\peripheral\flash_fds.
   This example shows how to use the FDS library.
 - Added support in Segger Embedded Studio and armgcc for editing the sdk_config.h file in the external graphical editor (CMSIS Configuration Wizard).

** BLE **
 - Bluetooth Peripheral examples now support the S112 SoftDevice.
   S112 is designed to work with the new SoC nRF52810. Examples targeting this new device are located in folder 'PCA10040E'.
   See SDK documentation for more details.

 - Added support for IPSP (Internet Protocol Support Profile).
  IPSP is now based on production-quality SoftDevice S132 v5.0.0. The IPSP is, also, a qualified profile.
  The IPSP service uses L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels to transfer data between devices.
    - The profile implementation added to components\ble\ble_services.
    - The IPSP Acceptor example added to examples\ble_peripheral\ble_app_ipsp_acceptor.
    - The IPSP Initiator example added to examples\ble_central\ble_app_ipsp_initiator.

 - Added all IoT components, including BLE 6LoWPAN, Nordic's IPv6 Stack, CoAP, MQTT, DFU over TFTP, lwIP port on nRF platform, and others.
    - Changes in these components in comparison to IoT SDK v0.9.0 are described in the Changes section of the release notes.

 - The SDK now supports firmware upgrade over TFTP (IPv6).
    - This mechanism for updating the firmware was earlier available in the IoT SDK, and is now a part of the nRF SDK.

 - New example app_ble_gatts added to examples\ble_central\experimental\ble_app_gatts.
   This application can be used to test the Service Changed indications together with app_ble_gatts_c.

 - Added S332 projects in Heart Rate Sensor and Heart Rate Collector examples.

** ANT **
 - Added support for the new SoftDevices: S212 v5.0.x and S332 v5.0.x.
 - Added S332 examples: 'Ant Shared Channels' and 'ANT and BLE Heart Rate Monitor Relay Application'.
 - Added S332 projects in ANT Message Types and ANT Bootloader examples.

** NFC **
 - Dynamic NFCID1 configuration in Type 2 and Type 4 Tag libraries.

** USB (Experimental) **
NOTE: The USB implementation is currently experimental and work in progress. Because of this, the code base and APIs
will change in-between SDK versions and will not necessarily be backwards compatible. This also applies to minor and
bugfix versions. Migration notes might not be complete for these changes.
 - nrf_drv_usbd:
    - New API function nrf_drv_usbd_ep_dtoggle_clear() implemented.
 - app_usbd:
    - Added a new function app_usbd_sof_timestamp_get() and its configuration APP_USBD_PROVIDE_SOF_TIMESTAMP.
      This function may be used to stamp the timing of the logger messages.
    - Interface selection mechanism provided.
      Currently, every class that contains alternate interface settings requires the class methods
      iface_select, iface_deselect, and iface_selection_get to be implemented.
      No action is required if only the classes provided in the SDK are used.
    - New event implemented:
      APP_USBD_EVT_STATE_CHANGED – called when the state of USB interface is updated.

** DTM **
 - Added support for the new SoC nRF52810.

** Serialization **
 - Added solution for serialization of the combined BLE and ANT SoftDevice, using the ble_ant_app_hrm example as the use case.
 - Added BLE connectivity (S132) support for nRF52810 (emulated on PCA10040).

** Drivers and libraries **
 - Added examples: UART and SAADC for nRF52810.
  Examples targeting this new chip are located in the 'PCA10040E' folder. See SDK documentation for more details.
 - Added the sorted list module (nrf_sortlist).

** IOT **
 - Added experimental examples under the "examples\iot" folder and libraries in the "components\iot" folder.
  They show the usage of IPv6 over Bluetooth low energy using IPSP and 6LoWPAN. The demonstrated protocols include:
    - BSD Sockets,
    - UDP and TCP,
    - DTLS and TLS,
    - CoAP and Secure CoAP,
    - MQTT and Secure MQTT,
    - TFTP and LWM2M,
    - Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) over TFTP,
    - DNS, ICMP, and SNTP.


*** Changes
************

** BLE **
 - BLE event handler priorities have changed (BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO).
    - The order of some module BLE event handlers has been changed. This means that compiling
      new sdk_config.h files with old modules might lead to crashes.
    - A new priority has been added, and all BLE applications have been changed to have
      the new priority (NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO_LEVELS has been changed from 3 to 4).
      This means that compiling new main files with old sdk_config.h files will not work
      unless NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO_LEVELS is set to 4 or more.
 - Peer Manager
    - Added a new event PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_PARAMS_REQ and a new function pm_conn_sec_params_reply()
      to allow setting security parameters for individual security procedures. Calling
      pm_conn_sec_params_reply() is optional.
    - Added a new configuration parameter PM_CENTRAL_ENABLED which removes the pairing functionality
      for the central role when turned off, saving code size.
    - Added a new informational event PM_EVT_SLAVE_SECURITY_REQ. No further Peer Manager action is
      expected from the user in response to this event.
    - Added a new event PM_EVT_FLASH_GARBAGE_COLLECTED which indicates that garbage collection has happened
      in the flash storage, possibly freeing up space for new bonds.
    - Added new function pm_address_resolve() for resolving BLE addresses.
 - NFC BLE Pairing Library
    - Added library support for the PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_PARAMS_REQ event from the Peer Manager.
      NOTE:
    ----------------------------------------
    After the change in Peer Manager priority, this change in API was necessary to properly support all pairing modes.
    Action: Call the nfc_ble_pair_on_pm_params_req() function inside the Peer Manager event handler in response to the
    PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_PARAMS_REQ event:
       case PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_PARAMS_REQ:
       {
          // Send event to the NFC BLE pairing library as it may dynamically alternate
          // security parameters to achieve highest possible security level.
          err_code = nfc_ble_pair_on_pm_params_req(p_evt);
          APP_ERROR_CHECK(err_code);
       } break;
    ------------------------------------------
 - The Heart Rate Application with BLE Pairing Using NFC Pairing Library now requires LESC
   pairing to enable Heart Rate notifications.
 - The LESC example now generates the DH key in the main thread so as not to hold up the
   SoftDevice's BLE event queue.

** BLE IoT **
 - Changes from the previous IoT SDK v0.9.0 release:
    - The 6LoWPAN library has been rewritten to adopt the new S132 v5.0.0 SoftDevice providing L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels feature.
      The library is now distributed in source code format and not as a precompiled library.
    - API breakers in many of the components including BLE IPSP, BLE 6LoWPAN, MQTT, nRF lwIP driver port, and background DFU.
    - Deprecated the cloud examples. Cloud services used in them were not suitable any more.
      The protocol features required to connect to a cloud are included and supported.
    - lwIP external component has been updated to version 2.0.2.
    - mbedTLS external component has been updated to version 2.4.2.

** NFC **
 - Removed the SoftDevice from the Writable NDEF Message example.
   This example no longer requires the SoftDevice.
 - All NFC libraries now have static configuration in the sdk_config.h file.

** USB (experimental) **
 - nrf_drv_usbd:
    - Endpoint transfers are no longer aborted inside the USB RESET handler,
      any transfer is now aborted when an endpoint is disabled.
    - The nrf_drv_usbd_transfer_out_drop() function now does not start any dummy transfer –  the endpoint is cleared by
      writing correct values to SIZE.EPOUT registers or backdoor interface for the sample chip.
    - Transfer can be started on a stalled endpoint.
      In the previous version, NRF_ERROR_FORBIDDEN error was returned.
      However, the possibility to stall the endpoint and prepare the answer that will be sent
      after the stall is cleared by the HOST appeared to be widely used in MSC.
    - Function rename: usbd_drv_ep_abort -> nrf_drv_usbd_ep_abort.
 - app_usbd:
    - All endpoints but 0 are disabled when the device is not configured.
      This matches USB requirements.
    - Function app_usbd_active_check provided – this allows to check whether
      there is any active USB traffic or interface is suspended.
      The macros APP_USB_STATE_BASE and APP_USBD_STATE_SUSPENDED_MASK removed.
      The app_usbd_state_t enumeration now provides no information about suspended states.
      Use app_usbd_active_check function whenever the SUSPEND state was checked via app_usbd_core_state_get function.
    - The SETUP event processing cleaned up, normalized, and documented.
      Clear rules for the order in which a class and default handlers are called.
    - Functions app_usbd_core_ep_(handled_)transfer() and app_usbd_core_setup_data_(handled_)transfer()
      unified and replaced by app_usbd_ep_(handled_)transfer functions:
          app_usbd_core_ep_transfer()                 -> app_usbd_ep_transfer()
          app_usbd_core_ep_handled_transfer()         -> app_usbd_ep_handled_transfer()
          app_usbd_core_setup_data_transfer()         -> app_usbd_ep_transfer()
          app_usbd_core_setup_data_handled_transfer() -> app_usbd_ep_handled_transfer()
  - Classes implementation:
    - Audio class implementation aligned to use the new alternate interface selection functionality.
    - MSC class implementation error handling totally rebuilt to match the specification.
      Now, it is stable and passes all USB precertification tests (with one small warning to be corrected in the future).

** Crypto **
 - Infineon Optiga Trust E communication library and authentication example are now in production quality.

** Drivers and libraries **
 - Command Line Interface (CLI) library is now in production quality.
 - Logger (nrf_log) can process logs after panic mode.
 - app_twi modules renamed to nrf_twi_mngr. Translation layer (app_twi.h) kept for backward compatibility.


*** Bugfixes
****************

** BLE **
 - Peer Manager:
    - Fixed a bug where a bonded and encrypted link could have invalid peer ID when the
      Central uses a random non-resolvable address.
    - Fixed a bug where the Service Changed state was always reported as "true" when
      changed.
    - Fixed a bug where peer rank was not written during pm_peer_rank_highest() if the
      highest ranked peer was deleted and the peer ID was reused, or if the peer rank
      value was manually changed or deleted.
    - Fixed a bug where pm_conn_sec_status() would incorrectly return false for bonded field when
      called during the PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_SUCCEEDED event for a reconnected bonded peer.
    - Fixed a bug where pm_conn_secure() would return an undocumented error code if called
      multiple times before the first procedure has completed.
    - Fixed the ordering of events from pm_peers_delete(). The PM_EVT_PEERS_DELETE_SUCCEEDED
      will now arrive after all PM_EVT_PEER_DELETE_SUCCEEDED events.
 - Fixed a bug in ble_app_queued_writes where the characteristic would use the BLE UUID type
   instead of a vendor type.
 - Fixed a bug in ble_app_gls where the connection handle would be unassigned before the
   disconnect call is issued (The connection handle is needed for the disconnect call).
 - Fixed a bug in ble_app_gls where the Record Access Control Point indications would not be retried if an indication procedure was already in progress.
 - Fixed a bug in ble_app_ancs_c where a missing C++ guard prevented it from compiling
   correctly using C++.
 - Fixed the LESC example so that it properly handles simultaneous security operations on both
   links (numeric match and DHKEY generation).
 - Fixed a bug in ble_app_ias_c where receiving a "Mild Alert" would print "No Alert" on the log, and "No Alert" would print "Mild Alert".
 - Fixed a bug in ble_app_cgms where the connection handle would be set to invalid before calling sd_ble_gap_disconnect(). This would cause the call to fail and the app would assert.
 - Fixed a bug in ble_app_hids_keyboard and ble_app_hids_mouse where the battery reading done before the connection was secured could cause the app to assert.
 - Fixed a bug in ble_app_multirole_lesc where it would not handle PHY update requests.
 - Fixed a bug that could prevent FDS from working properly when using the new nrf_fstorage_nvmc backend.
 - Fixed a bug that could prevent FDS from working properly when using the nrf_fstorage_sd backend with the SoftDevice disabled.
 - Keil will no longer delete the SoftDevice HEX file if the flash_softdevice target is compiled.

** Crypto **
 - Enforced the alignment on nrf_crypto buffers for signature types.
 - Removed an unused file (nrf_crypto.c) that would cause compilation errors for some users.

** DFU **
 - Added a workaround for updating SoftDevices with changed size (from SDK 12.x.y -> 14.1.x). See configuration parameter NRF_DFU_WORKAROUND_PRE_SDK_14_1_0_SD_BL_UPDATE.
 
** NFC **
 - Type 4 Tag HAL:
    - Handling of erroneous NFC-A data frames (with parity and CRC errors) has been
      improved.

** USB (Experimental) **
 - HAL:
     - Function nrf_usbd_dtoggle_set() is fixed. The previous version was not functional.
       It was working in the examples thanks to the fact that nrf_usbd_dtoggle_get()
       function was called before every nrf_usbd_dtoggle_set().

** Drivers and libraries **
 - Fixed a bug where SPI MISO was missing a pulldown.
    Currently, the pulldown status can be configured with the SDK configuration parameter: NRF_SPI_DRV_MISO_PULLUP_CFG.
 - Fixed a bug where the length parameters passed to macro NRF_LOG_HEXDUMP_DEBUG were not calculated correctly.
 - Fixed a bug where a user could receive a "wrong configuration" error during the compilation of SPI driver.
 - Fixed a bug where extern "C" was not terminated correctly in the Logger module.
 - Fixed a bug in the PPI example where Timer 2 was not generating a CC event every odd second.
 - Fixed the header guard in the ble_l2cap_conn.h file.
 - Fixed a bug where nrf_log could crash when heavily loaded.
 - Fixed the pwm_library example which was not working correcly when compiled with highest optimization on IAR.

** Serialization **
 - Fixed encoding of ble_gap_data_length_params_t and ble_gap_data_length_limitation_t structures.
 - Fixed encoding of ble_gap_evt_auth_status_t::lesc.
 - Fixed serialization of GATT MTU value
   (https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/165596/scanner-doesnt-work-on-nrf52832sdk-14/)
 - Fixed improper configuration of scheduler event size in serialized examples
   (https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/166657/serialization-for-s132-5x-triggers-buffer-overflow-in-event-scheduling/)


*** Known Issues
****************

** BLE **
 - When working on the emulated nRF52810 target, if you change the optimization level and/or add the logging functionality, the project might not compile or fail at runtime due to not enough flash available for FDS or Peer Manager.
 - All Bluetooth applications not using the nrf_queued_write module will assert when a peer sends a Write request with the opcode 'cancel all operations' (BLE_GATTS_OP_EXEC_WRITE_REQ_CANCEL), after the SoftDevice call to sd_ble_gatts_rw_authorize_reply. This SoftDevice call, for the opcode 'cancel all operations', returns NRF_INVALID_PARAMS if the gatt_status is not BLE_GATT_STATUS_SUCCESS.

** BLE IOT **
 - Neighbor discovery module for lwIP requires the on-link flag in the router advertisement to be set in order to create a SLAAC address from the prefix. However, RFC 7668 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7668) requires this bit to be zero. Therefore, the nd6.c from lwIP source has been modified to relax this check.
 - There are some issues when using the IoT examples against Linux Kernel 4.12+ which causes the kernel to only work with one 6LoWPAN connection. If more than one kit is connected using 6LoWPAN, none of the nodes will be accessible.
 - Scheduler has been included in most IoT examples to avoid race conditions found when using lwIP stack, more precisely the TCP examples.
   The issue was that the TCP client stopped working after about 15 hours. However, when using mbedTLS, the use of scheduler is not possible.
   Therefore, the MQTT client examples might be affected by this issue.
 - The use of security, both with TLS and DTLS, should be treated as experimental.
 - MQTT examples cannot be used with commissioning. There is not enough RAM to accommodate both TLS and the commissioning service.

** NFC **
 - NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER 4 on nRF52832.
 - Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag ("NFC Tools" and "TagWriter" v4.1
   seem to be okay to use).

** USB (experimental) **
 - MSC implementation does not stall when the host requires more bytes than are available in the selected descriptor. It is not a problem for any tested driver on Windows and Linux, but still violates the specification.
 - During high USB traffic, in rare cases, communication might hang or the endpoint data might be transferred twice. See PAN 104.

** Drivers and libraries **
  - SAADC driver is not handling detection limits 'high' and 'low' correctly if SAADC resolution is greater than 10 bits.

- Dynastream's D52DK1 (only for ANT examples)

For other devices and boards, see the SDK documentation, section "Using
the SDK with other boards".


*** Scope for the nRF52840 chip
********************************
All examples and libraries for the new chip must be treated as
experimental.
Some examples have not been ported to run on nRF52840. Check the
existing example projects to see which targets are supported.

The following SDK features are supported on the new nRF52840 chip:
  - IEEE 802.15.4 stack library with an example
  - Most BLE, hardware peripheral, and NFC examples (with some
    exceptions; see the available example projects for details)
  - Peripheral HAL and drivers (both for existing and new peripherals)
  - Cryptography library including CryptoCell CC310 backend
  - NFC Type 2 Tag and Type 4 Tag
  - Secure DFU (only with micro-ecc backend)
  - DTM including support for the new Bluetooth 5 features

   - ANT
   - ESB and Gazell
   - FreeRTOS
   - Eddystone
   - Serialization of the S140 SoftDevice v5.0.0-2.alpha


*** New features
*****************

** BLE **
 - Added support for IPSP (Internet Protocol Support Profile). The IPSP service uses L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels to transfer data between devices.
     - Implementation added to components\ble\ble_services.
     - IPSP Acceptor example added to examples\ble_peripheral\ble_app_ipsp_acceptor.
     - IPSP Initiator example added to examples\ble_central\ble_app_ipsp_initiator.

** Drivers and libraries **
 - Added experimental examples under the "examples\iot" folder and libraries in the "components\iot" folder that show the usage of IPv6 over Bluetooth Smart using IPSP and 6LoWPAN. The demonstrated protocols include:
     - BSD Sockets,
     - UDP and TCP,
     - DTLS and TLS,
     - CoAP and Secure CoAP,
     - MQTT and Secure MQTT,
     - TFTP and LWM2M,
     - Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) over TFTP,
     - DNS, ICMP, and SNTP.

*** Changes
************

** BLE IOT **
 - Changes from the previous nRF5 IoT SDK 0.9.0 release
    - The 6LoWPAN library has been rewritten to adopt the new S132 v5.0.0 SoftDevice providing L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels. The library is now distributed in source code format and not as a precompiled library.
    - LWIP external component has been updated to version 2.0.2.
    - mbedTLS external component has been updated to version 2.4.2.

*** Known Issues
****************

** Overall **
 - In the UART peripheral example, only a line feed (LF) is output on startup and when resetting the board.
 - Serialized Direct Test Mode does not report RX packet count correctly.

** BLE **
 - It is possible that the Peer Manager may return corrupt data when attempting to read the GATT attributes table under some circumstances when FDS CRC checks are enabled.
 - In the Multiperipheral Example, LED 3 will toggle when writing any non-zero value to it. Also, two notifications instead of one are received on the Button Characteristic (0x1524) when pressing Button 1.
 - For all serialized applications, the MTU size (NRF_SDH_BLE_GATT_MAX_MTU_SIZE in sdk_config.h) should be kept at the default level. Changing this value makes the application non-functional as the connectivity application uses static size buffers.
 - Eddystone Beacon Application - LED indication might differ from what is described in documentation under the Testing section.

** BLE IOT **
 - Neighbor discovery module for lwIP requires the on-link flag in the router advertisement to be set in order to create a SLAAC address from the prefix. However, RFC 7668 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7668) requires this bit to be zero. Therefore, the nd6.c from lwIP source has been modified to relax this check.
 - There are some issues using the IoT examples against Linux Kernel 4.12+ which causes the kernel to only work with one 6LoWPAN connection. If more than one kit is connected using 6LoWPAN, none of the nodes will be accessible.

** ANT **
- Most ANT examples do not have the nrf_log backend in the project files, so enabling logging does not have any effect.

** NFC **
 - NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
 - Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag (the "NFC Tools" app seems to
   be okay to use).
 - BLE peripheral examples with NFC pairing work as expected only with Android 7.1.2.

** DFU **
 - Downgrading from nRF5 SDK v14.0.0 to nRF5 SDK v13.0.0 has been observed to cause the v13.0.0 bootloader to corrupt itself (Upgrading works as expected).
 - The S140 SoftDevice currently does not support updating of the bootloader.
 - The CTX pin (P0.07) should be grounded to run the Serial Secure DFU on both nRF52832 and nRF52840 boards.
 - BLE/Serial Secure DFU only supports nrfutil 2.3.0.
 - For nRF52840, a combined SoftDevice and application update on Serial transport fails when using nrfutil 2.3.0. Running a single SoftDevice and application update sequentially works as expected.

 ** USB **
 - USB driver Anomaly 104 solution is very unstable in IAR compilation with high optimization level.


========================================================================

************
** Common **
 - All examples are modified to use the new SoftDevice Handler (nrf_sdh).

** BLE **
 - BLE Connection Parameter module supports multiple peripheral links.
 - BLE ATT MTU example uses nrf_cli for the user interface.

** NFC **
 - Improved the Type 4 Tag library interoperability (added support for fragmented command APDUs and fixed DID field handling).
 - NDEF record and message definition macros are defined as automatic data (used to be static).

** DFU **
 - Serial DFU has been updated to be production quality.

** Proprietary **
 - ESB: Added workarounds for several anomalies that were impacting performance for certain addresses.
 - ESB: Added functionality to update certain radio parameters while ESB is running:
	- uint32_t nrf_esb_set_retransmit_delay(uint16_t delay);
	- uint32_t nrf_esb_set_retransmit_count(uint16_t count);
	- uint32_t nrf_esb_set_bitrate(nrf_esb_bitrate_t bitrate);

*** Bugfixes
****************

** BLE **
 - Fixed a bug where the multiperipheral example would not be able to connect to more than one link.

** NFC **
 - Implemented several fixes in Type 2 and Type 4 libraries (fixed nfc_t4t_parameter_set function, removed nRF52 startup code and FPU support from library compilation).

** Drivers and libraries **
 - Fixed potential overflow in the watchdog timer (WDT) driver initialization.
 - Fixed wrong header guard in nrf_nvic.h (https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/121041/incorrect-header-guard-in-nrf_nvich/).
 - Fixed a bug where nrf_drv_spi_uninit did not clear an event (https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/116308/spi-init-triggers-old-nrf_spim_event_end).
 - Implemented a fix for nrf_drv_spi - no pulldown on MISO line.

*** Known Issues
****************

** Overall **
 - In the UART peripheral example, only a line feed (LF) is output on startup and when resetting the board.
 - Serialized Direct Test Mode does not report RX packet count correctly.

** BLE **
 - It is possible that the Peer Manager may return corrupt data when attempting to read the GATT attributes table under some circumstances when FDS CRC checks are enabled.
 - In the Multiperipheral Example, LED 3 will toggle when writing any non-zero value to it. Also, two notifications instead of one are received on the Button Characteristic (0x1524) when pressing Button 1.
 - For all serialized applications, the MTU size (NRF_SDH_BLE_GATT_MAX_MTU_SIZE in sdk_config.h) should be kept at the default level. Changing this value makes the application non-functional as the connectivity application uses static size buffers.
 - Eddystone Beacon Application - LED indication might differ from what is described in documentation under the Testing section.

** ANT **
- Most ANT examples do not have the nrf_log backend in the project files, so enabling logging does not have any effect.

** NFC **
 - NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
 - Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag (the "NFC Tools" app seems to
   be okay to use).
 - BLE peripheral examples with NFC pairing work as expected only with Android 7.1.2.

** DFU **
 - Downgrading from nRF5 SDK v14.0.0 to nRF5 SDK v13.0.0 has been observed to cause the v13.0.0 bootloader to corrupt itself (Upgrading works as expected).
 - The S140 SoftDevice currently does not support updating of the bootloader.
 - The CTX pin (P0.07) should be grounded to run the Serial Secure DFU on both nRF52832 and nRF52840 boards.
 - BLE/Serial Secure DFU only supports nrfutil 2.3.0.
 - For nRF52840, a combined SoftDevice and application update on Serial transport fails when using nrfutil 2.3.0. Running a single SoftDevice and application update sequentially works as expected.

 ** USB **
 - USB driver Anomaly 104 solution is very unstable in IAR compilation with high optimization level.

*** Changes
************

** ANT **
- Removed the nrf_sd_def.h file. It will be now distributed just like the rest of SoftDevice header files through
  https://www.thisisant.com


*** Bugfixes
*************

** Drivers and libraries **
- Fixed a potential overflow in watchdog timer (WDT) driver initialization.


*** Known Issues
*****************

** Overall **
- Updating the MDK requires to manually copy the header and linker files
  into the SDK folder (ARM Keil uVision 4, IAR Workbench, ARMGCC).
- When uploading an application to an nRF52 IC using nrfjprog, you must
  provide the "--reset/-r" argument or powercycle the board.

** BLE **
- Some examples might have excessively verbose logging.
- Examples that use the Peer Manager might assert when deleting bonds,
  because advertising is started twice.
- In the Proximity Application, writing "High Alert" to the AlertLevel
  characteristic of the Link Loss Service does not trigger a high alert
  when the link is lost.
- When an Android device is used as a peripheral, it sends slave
  security request with the MITM bit set. The central applications in
  the SDK will reject the security request (Pairing Failed) because
  they do not support MITM.
- Advertisement intervals in the Eddystone Beacon Application are not
  verified. Clients must ensure that the configured advertisement
  interval is within the valid range. Note that EID/eTLM configurations
  might require advertisement intervals to be larger than the default value.

** NFC **
- NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
- Type 2 Tag on nRF52840 chips might fail unpredictably.
- Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag ("NFC Tool" seems to
  be okay to use).


========================================================================

*** New features
*****************

** BLE **
- Added an experimental BLE Multiperipheral example
  (experimental_ble_app_multiperipheral) that uses the proprietary LED
  Button Service to show how a peripheral device can manage connections
  with multiple peers simultaneously.

** ANT **
- Added serialization for S212 v4.0.0. With this solution, an ANT
  application can run on any architecture, without the SoftDevice. All
  SoftDevice API calls are transported via UART to an nRF52 device that
  runs the ANT connectivity application (examples\connectivity\experimental_ant)
  and the S212 SoftDevice. The ANT I/O example demonstrates the new
  serialization solution (examples\ant\ant_io_demo, see targets:
  "ser_s212_uart"). Note that the serialized solution does not support
  the new API calls added in S212 v4.0.0.
  The SDK folders with the ANT serialization implementation are not
  marked as experimental, because the paths would be too long.
- Added a new ANT Frequency Agility example
  (examples\ant\experimental\ant_frequency_agility).

** 804.15.4 **
- Added a full 802.15.4 stack implementation to the SDK. The library
  (components\experimental_802_15_4) is available only for nRF52840
  devices. The MAC layer API is located in
  components\experimental_802_15_4\api\MAC. The example application is
  located in examples\802_15_4\experimental\wireless_uart.
- Added an experimental Wireless UART example (wireless_uart) that shows
  how to use the new 804.15.4 stack.

** NFC **
- Added two experimental examples that show NFC pairing (BLE Pairing
  Using NFC - experimental_ble_nfc_pairing_reference and
  ble_nfc_pairing_reference_c).

** DFU **
- Added support for serial/UART and an example for a secure DFU
  bootloader using UART (experimental).
- Implemented SoftDevice major version checks for certain upgrade types.
- Implemented a delayed reset after the DFU: After a SoftDevice,
  bootloader, or SoftDevice and bootloader update, a timer will start.
  If no new update is initiated before its expiration, the device will
  look for a valid application and launch it.
- Added a new set of error codes (extended error codes) that the DFU
  target may send as a response to the DFU controller to convey the
  reason for a failure.

** Serialization **
- Added serialization support for the ANT S212 SoftDevice v4.0.0
  (experimental). See the ANT section for details.

** Drivers and libraries **
- Added workarounds for the nRF52832 anomaly 109 (DMA: DMA access
  transfers might be corrupted). Affected drivers: PWM, SPIM, TWIM,
  SPIS, and TWIS.
- Added several new libraries:
    - Command line interface (CLI) library: Console that supports
      various serial interfaces (UART, RTT, USB CDC ACM).
      See the usage example in examples/peripheral/cli.
    - GFX library: Graphics library that supports simple operations like
      drawing circles, lines, rectangles, or bitmaps and printing
      strings. GFX uses an LCD driver interface. Two implementations for
      popular TFTs have been added (ILI9341, ST7735).
      See the usage example in examples/peripheral/gfx.
    - Serial port library: Module for handling UART communication. It
      supports multibyte transfers, time-outs, and buffering of data.
      The module is a replacement for app_uart.
      See the usage example in examples/peripheral/serial.
    - SPI transaction manager: Module for managing thread-safe access to
      the SPI driver. The module supports scheduling transactions that
      consist of multiple transfers. See the usage example in
      examples/peripheral/spi_master_using_nrf_spi_mngr.
    - Error code to string converter (STRERR): Module for converting
      error codes to strings. The module is used by nrf_log.
- Added two drivers for TFT LCDs: ILI9341 and ST7735.


*** Changes
************

** BLE **
- Updated all BLE examples to use the nRF Connect PC application
  (replacing Master Control Panel).

  Secure-DFU UUID (16-bit proprietary Nordic UUID).
- Updated the BLE Buttonless DFU characteristic to use a new
  vendor-specific base UUID (0x8EC9xxxx-F315-4F60-9FB8-838830DAEA50).
  The UUID changed to 0x8EC90003-F315-4F60-9FB8-838830DAEA50.
- Changed the BLE Buttonless DFU characteristic from notification to
  indication.
- Changed the minimum version requirement for nrfutil to v2.2.0.

** NFC **
- Updated the NFC Type 4 Tag library so that it can be released in
  production quality. The library was moved to components\nfc\t4t_lib.
  The example that shows the Type 4 Tag library is located in
  examples\nfc\writable_ndef_msg.
- Updated the BLE Heart Rate Collector Example with NFC Pairing and the
  HID Keyboard Application with BLE pairing using NFC to use the NFC BLE
  Pairing library (nfc_pair_lib).

    - nrf_drv_uart: Added a function for checking the receiver state.
    - nrf_drv_csense: Extended the driver to perform measurements using
      SAADC. COMP is still supported, but it is not recommended for
      production (see anomaly 84).


*** Bugfixes
*************

- Fixed several bugs in secure DFU to prevent handling invalid updates.
- Updated secure DFU on nRF52840 to utilize the entire 1 MB of flash, up
  from the old (unintended) limitation of 512 KB.

    - nrf_drv_saadc: Fixed a bug where nrf_drv_saadc_calibrate_offset()
      enabled a wrong interrupt.
    - nrf_drv_pwm: Fixed inaccurate description of the
      NRF_DRV_PWM_FLAG_LOOP flag.


*** Known Issues
*****************

** BLE **
- If the S132 SoftDevice is configured with 0 Peripheral roles and 0
  Central roles, sd_ble_enable() may corrupt up to 8 bytes above the
  returned app_ram_base. For applications having such a configuration,
  set the application RAM start to 8 bytes or more above the returned
  app_ram_base.

** DFU **
- The S140 SoftDevice currently does not support updating the bootloader.
- Secure DFU (serial):
    - nrfutil currently does not support sending combined zip images
      (SD+APP, SD+BL+APP, BL+SD). Use individually generated zip-images
      instead.
    - The device will not automatically boot the application after a
      SoftDevice update. Reset the device manually.
- Secure DFU (BLE): Updates of SD+BL+APP may time out between the SD+BL
  and APP stage on certain Android phones. Investigate the time-out
  value with respect to your mobile app and consider increasing it.

- Fixed a bug in the ANCS Client Application where using RFU attribute
  IDs could cause illegal memory access.
- Modified the LE Secure Connections Multirole Example to prevent
  creation of a second link to the same peer simultaneously.

** NFC **
- Fixed a bug in NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL where NFC would hang when
  the chip was woken up from SYSTEM_OFF and HFXO was started before NFCT
  requested it.

** Serialization **
- UART and HCI UART transports have been optimized to better utilize
  EasyDMA.


*** Known Issues
****************

** Overall **
- Updating the MDK requires to manually copy the header and linker files
  into the SDK folder (ARM Keil uVision 4, IAR Workbench, ARMGCC).
- When uploading an application to an nRF52 IC using nrfjprog, you must
  provide the "--reset/-r" argument or powercycle the board.

** BLE **
- Some examples might have excessively verbose logging.
- Examples that use the Peer Manager might assert when deleting bonds,
  because advertising is started twice.
- In the Proximity Application, writing "High Alert" to the AlertLevel
  characteristic of the Link Loss Service does not trigger a high alert
  when the link is lost.
- When an Android device is used as a peripheral, it sends slave
  security request with the MITM bit set. The central applications in
  the SDK will reject the security request (Pairing Failed) because
  they do not support MITM.
- Advertisement intervals in the Eddystone Beacon Application are not
  verified. Clients must ensure that the configured advertisement
  interval is within the valid range. Note that EID/eTLM configurations
  might require advertisement intervals larger than the default value.

** NFC **
- NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
- Type 2 Tag on nRF52840 chips might fail unpredictably.
- Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag ("NFC Tool" seems to
  be okay to use).

  the SoftDevice event priority.
- Prefixed error codes with "NRF_".
- Fixed a bug in the clock driver where the driver was failing to handle
  two requests coming from the same source.
- Removed nRF52 support for RTX. RTX is now supported on nRF51 chips
  only.
- Updated the example Secure DFU images. They are now created with the
  debug flag enabled.
- Modified the SoftDevice header files nrf_soc.h and nrf_nvic.h to
  support PCA10056 (nRF52840).
- Split up the files located in the examples\bsp folder to new locations:
  components\libraries\bsp and components\boards.

** Drivers and libraries **
- Updated the RNG driver so that it supports the SoftDevice being
  enabled and disabled. Removed the function nrf_drv_rng_pool_capacity().
- Changed the API for function app_button_is_pushed() (located in
  app_button.h).
- Extended the app_gpiote API to support more than 32 pins. Removed
  unimplemented functions from the API.
- Extended the nrf_gpio API to support more than 32 pins. Removed
  functions that referred to 8-bit ports (for example,
  nrf_gpio_port_read).
- Removed the function nrf_drv_adc_gpio_to_ain() from the
  nrf_drv_adc API.
- Removed the function nrf_drv_comp_gpio_to_ain() from the
  nrf_drv_comp API.
- Removed the function nrf_drv_saadc_gpio_to_ain() from the
  nrf_drv_saadc API.

** BLE **
- Fixed an issue that would cause some central examples to fail when
  restarting scanning using a whitelist.
- Updated the Peer Manager modules to return NRF_ERROR_STORAGE_FULL
  instead of NRF_ERROR_NO_MEM.
- The field "peer_id" in the Peer Manager structure
  "pm_peer_data_bonding_t" has been renamed to "peer_ble_id".
- Fixed an issue where the Database Discovery Module would not
  re-initialize properly upon successive discoveries.
- Fixed an issue where the Database Discovery Module would fail to
  discover the extended properties descriptor and the characteristic
  user description descriptors.

  example application could crash if the connecting iPhone disconnected
  immediately after connecting.

** NFC **
- Modified the Adafruit NFC Shield library to support reading Type 2 and
  Type 4 Tags.
- Improved performance of the Adafruit library in Type 2 Tag reader mode
  (faster read).
- Added LE Secure Connections OOB values encoding in ble_pair_msg.
- Enabled dynamic update of the TK value in ble_pair_msg.


*** Known Issues
****************

** Overall **
- Updating the MDK requires to manually copy the header and linker files
  into the SDK folder (ARM Keil uVision 4, IAR Workbench, ARMGCC).
- When uploading an application to an nRF52 IC using nrfjprog, you must
  provide the "--reset/-r" argument or powercycle the board.
- RTX is not supported on nRF52 chips.

** BLE **
- Some examples might have excessively verbose logging.
- In the Proximity Application, writing "High Alert" to the AlertLevel
  characteristic of the Link Loss Service does not trigger a high alert
  when the link is lost.
- When an Android device is used as a peripheral, it sends slave
  security request with the MITM bit set. The central applications in
  the SDK will reject the security request (Pairing Failed) because
  they do not support MITM.
- Eddystone Beacon Application:
   - Advertisement intervals are not verified. Clients must ensure that
     the configured advertisement interval is within the valid range.
     Note that EID/eTLM configurations might require advertisement
     intervals larger than the default value.
   - Caution: On nRF51 devices, eTLM calculation takes around 500 ms
     and is performed once per EID slot in the same interrupt level
     priority as the 'Unlock' functionality. Therefore, if multiple EID
     slots and an eTLM slot are configured, the client might not be able
     to unlock a beacon that has an eTLM slot and uses the default
     advertisement interval. To resolve this issue, increase the
     advertisement interval.
- Buttonless DFU Template Application (experimental):
   - The project setup of the example is wrong and does not fit into the
     available space below the DFU bootloader. To fix this problem,
     change the IROM1 size from 0x61000 to 0x59000. In addition, comment
     out the code section that reserves a codepage at 0x7E000 for MBR
     parameters. For details, see
     https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/100609/sdk-12-bootloader-erased-after-programming/
   - To switch to DFU mode, you must write to the DFU control point.
     However, this characteristic is set as read only. Add the following
     code line to enable the write property:
       char_md.char_props.write = 1;
     For details, see
     https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/93414/sdk12-ble_app_buttonless_dfu/#95079


** NFC **
- NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
- Type 2 Tag on nRF52840 chips might fail unpredictably.
- Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag ("NFC Tool" seems to be
  okay to use).


========================================================================

****************
** Overall **
- Serialization of the S132 SoftDevice v3.0.


*** Changes
***********

** Overall **
- Includes the latest Nordic MDK v8.9.0.
- Small documentation updates.


*** Known issues
****************

** Overall **
- Updating the MDK requires to manually copy the header and linker files
  into the SDK folder (ARM Keil uVision 4, IAR Workbench, ARMGCC).
- When uploading an application to an nRF52 IC using nrfjprog, you must
  provide the "--reset/-r" argument or powercycle the board.

** BLE **
- When performing service discoveries after a reconnect,
  ble_db_discovery might fail to initialize. Refer to this link for a fix:
  https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/92452/nrf52-ble_db_discovery-failed-to-initialize-correctly-when-repeats-the-service-discovery/
- The "UART/Serial Port Emulation over BLE" (ble_app_uart) example
  does not compile with nrf_log enabled (missing nrf_log sources)
- Some examples might have excessively verbose logging.
- Performing pairing without bonding will cause examples to assert. To
  fix this, make sure the call to pm_peer_rank_highest() during
  PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_SUCCEEDED happens only when the procedure is
  PM_LINK_SECURED_PROCEDURE_BONDING.
- When an Android device is used as a peripheral, it sends slave
  security request with the MITM bit set. The central applications in
  the SDK will reject the security request (Pairing Failed) because
  they do not support MITM.

** Secure DFU **
 - nRF Toolbox for iPhone:
   - When an error occurs, nRF Toolbox does not automatically
     disconnect. You must therefore reset the board manually to
     disconnect before you can connect again.
   - It is not possible to abort a transfer when the device connection
     is lost.
   - On resumption, nRF Toolbox does not call execute, which makes it
     impossible to resume a transfer.
   - When transferring a combined SoftDevice and bootloader image, the
     bootloader might not be updated.
   - On nRF52 devices, the DFU operation is sometimes reported as
     completed, even though the device is not updated.

** NFC **
- NFC Type 2 Tag HAL requires using TIMER4 on nRF52832.

- The Adafruit Tag Reader Example has been extended to show added NDEF
  parsing functionality.
- The NFC Type 2 Tag HAL was improved with a workaround for supporting
  low power mode.

** Proprietary **
- A new implementation of the Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) protocol
  supporting both nRF51 and nRF52 has been added.

*** Fixed issues
****************

** Drivers and libraries **
- GPIOTE: Fixed the problem of lost events in low-accuracy sense toggle
          mode
- SAADC: Added functionality to use one AIN with multiple channels
- UART: Fixed a glitch on TX pin when initializing the driver
- UART: Fixed the problem that TX bytes were sent in wrong order in
        app_uart_fifo

** BLE **
- Removed a vulnerability in Peer Manager and Device Manager that would
  allow malicious attackers to overwrite the bonding information of a
  bonded device

** ANT **
- Fixed the handling of send-until-success request types in the ANT
  request controller
- Fixed an ant_evt_t structure member alignment bug

** NFC **
- Fixed the NFC examples to work when the UART logger is enabled
- Fixed a buffer leakage bug in the module for creating
  application/vnd.bluetooth.le.oob records

*** Known issues
****************

** Drivers and libraries **
- Using the NVIC API directly and not through a SoftDevice causes
  problems, especially when NVIC_EnableIRQ or NVIC_DisableIRQ are called
  from critical sections.

** BLE **
- All BLE examples have been tested only on PCA10028 and PCA10040.
- BLE Examples that use pairing are incompatible with examples in SDK
  version 6.1 and earlier that do not use pairing.

** ANT **
- Previous versions of the ANT DFU example are incompatible with the ANT
  S212/S332 SoftDevices version 0.9.x.

** NFC **
- NFCT requires using TIMER4 on nRF52832.

** FPU **
- When the FPU is in use, it triggers the FPU_IRQn interrupt when one of
  the six exception flags (IDC, IXC, UFC, OFC, DZC, IOC) is set.
  The FPU interrupt will always set the pending flag (even if the
  interrupt is not enabled), irrespective of whether the user is
  interested in the exception bit.
  The pending flag then prevents the SoftDevice from going into low
  power mode when sd_app_evt_wait() is called.
  Therefore, always clear the exception bits and the pending interrupt
  before calling sd_app_evt_wait(). See the code below for an example
  implementation.
  FPU exception bit definition:
  http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0553a/BABBFJEC.html
  Example code:
  {
  // Set bit 7 and bits 4..0 in the mask to one (0x ...00 1001 1111)
  #define FPU_EXCEPTION_MASK 0x0000009F

  ...
      /* Clear exceptions and PendingIRQ from the FPU unit */
      __set_FPSCR(__get_FPSCR()  & ~(FPU_EXCEPTION_MASK));
      (void) __get_FPSCR();
      NVIC_ClearPendingIRQ(FPU_IRQn);

      /* Call SoftDevice Wait For event */
      error_code = sd_app_evt_wait();
  }

    memory address limitation of 0x40000 (256 KB) for the application.


BLE:

  Changes:
  - All BLE examples have been tested only on PCA10028 and PCA10040.
  - The S13x SoftDevice v2.0.0-7.alpha is configurable, which leads to a
    variable RAM setup:

Changes:

  Drivers and libraries:
    New features:
        - Ported FreeRTOS to run on nRF51. Added two FreeRTOS examples: one
          to run on bare metal and one running a BLE HRS example using the
          S110 and S130 SoftDevices.
        - Added a TWI transaction manager module for managing access to an

          PWM). Added an example that shows how to use this module.
        - Added an LED softblink module that uses the low-power PWM. Added
          an example that shows how to use this module.
        - Ported app_uart to use the UART driver and moved it to the

    Fixed issues:
        - Mailbox module moved out of serialization.
        - Bug fixes in app_timer module.
        - App_timer module no longer requires to define the number of

  ANT:
    New features:
     - Added the following new ANT modules:
         - ant_encryption
         - ant_key_manager
         - ant_search_config
     - Extended/changed the following existing ANT modules:
         - ant_channel_config
         - ant_stack_config
         - ant_state_indicator
     - Refactored the ANT/ANT+ examples and profiles to make them look more
       similar to the BLE profiles and examples:
         - The following ANT+ profiles have been extracted and extended:
           Bicycle Power (ant_bpwr), Bicycle Speed & Cadence (ant_bsc),
           Stride Based Speed & Distance (ant_sdm)
         - All ANT+ examples have been refactored to use extracted
           profiles.
         - All ANT+/ANT examples have been refactored to use created
           modules.
     - Added three new ANT examples:
         - ant_scalable
         - ant_scalable_encrypted
         - ant_scan_and_forward

    BLE:
     - Added an experimental module named Peer Manager. This module will
       eventually replace the existing Device Manager. The new Peer Manager
       improves on the Device Manager in multiple ways, mainly by
       supporting concurrent central and peripheral connections.
     - Added an experimental flash memory module named Flash Data Storage
       (FDS), which greatly reduces the need for time-consuming write and
       clear operations. When using FDS, data can be arbitrarily long or
       short (within about a page). All pieces of data are tagged with
       types, which makes it easy to version data.
     - Updated the experimental HRS/RSCS Relay example:
        - It now uses the new Peer Manager instead of the Device Manager.
          Therefore, it now supports bonding in both central and peripheral
          roles.
        - It uses the new nrf_log module, which can use SEGGER RTT.
     - Removed the app_s130_demo example.
     - Added an experimental example supporting the Eddystone beacon
       format.
     - Added the BLE Connection State module, which keeps track of certain
       states of each connection (for example, whether it is encrypted) and
       can also keep track of user-defined states.
     - Added the Mapped Flags module, which keeps track of flags that are
       mapped to keys. It is used by the BLE Connection State module.
     - Added ble_gatt_db.h (containing a GATT service structure) and
       modified ble_db_discovery module to use it.
    BLE Services:
     - Updated the Bluetoothds_template application (experimental) to be
       compatible with Bluetooth Developer Studio v1.0 and the Nordic
       Semiconductor NRF5X v1.1.8 plugin.
     - Added three new services:
        - Location Navigation Service (experimental)
        - Proprietary LED Button Service (experimental)
        - Nordic UART Client Service (experimental)

Fixed issues:
     - App_pwm occasionally gives inverted signal.

Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multi-role S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on
          S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum
      connection interval of 11.25 ms. The application cannot handle
      connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system
      reset in the middle of a firmware update.
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware
                  update process, consider increasing the connection
                  interval used by the master.
    - The old manual procedure for testing buttonless DFU, as specified in
      the documentation, can lead to the DFU process hanging or returning
      an error when used with Master Control Panel 3.8 and newer.
    - Bootloader binaries (.bin files) generated with the GCC makefile
      should not be used. Instead, generate the bootloader bin files using
      nrfutils, found on GitHub.

========================================================================

----------------
Release date: Week 42, 2015

This is an amendment to nRF52 SDK v0.9.1.

Highlights:
    - New targets to enable the two near field communication (NFC)
      examples to run on the new PCA10040 development board with
      nRF52832 IC rev. Engineering B.

Libraries:
    - Extended the NFC HAL layer of the NFC library to support the NFCT
      peripherial for both the chip version delivered with the nRF52
      Preview Development Kit (Engineering A: QFAA-AA0, QFAA-AC0,
      CGAA-AA0) and the chip version delivered with the nRF52 Development
      Kit (Engineering B: QFAA-BA0, QFAA-BB0, CHAA-AA0, CHAA-AB0).

Examples:
    - Added PCA10040 as target bord for the following examples:
      - Heart Rate Example with pairing over NFC
      - NFC URL Record Application

      of nRF52 Preview Development Kit), globally define
      HAL_NFC_ENGINEERING_A_FTPAN_WORKAROUND in your project.
    - The TIMER4 peripheral is used to implement one of the workarounds
      for PCA10036. This workaround is not used for PCA10040.
    - The ble_app_hrs_pairing_nfc example is unable to wake up from
      system off.

      read-only state
    - Added a module to generate NFC NDEF messages for BLE pairing over NFC
    - Added a module to generate NFC NDEF messages with an URI record type
    - Extended the ble_advdata module

Examples:
    - Added ble_app_hrs_pairing_nfc example that demonstrates pairing over
      NFC (with S132 SoftDevice)
    - Added record_url NFC example that demonstrates exposing a URL record
      (without SoftDevice)

Limitations:
    - The current version of the NFC library uses TIMER4.
    - The ble_app_hrs_pairing_nfc example has been tested only with Samsung
      Galaxy S6.
    - If the path to the SDK directory is too long, compilation in Keil fails.
      To work around this problem, move the SDK higher in the folder tree
      or use shorter folder names.

         update process, consider increasing the connection interval used
         by the master.
    - App_pwm occasionally gives inverted signal.
    - The old manual procedure for testing buttonless DFU, as specified in
      the documentation, can lead to the DFU process hanging or returning

        - S310 support will be reintroduced in a future release.
    BLE:
        - SoftDevices:
            - Support for S130 v1.0.0.

Fixed issues:
    - NRFFOSDK-2044: Fixed issue in app_gpiote.
    - NRFFOSDK-3855: Fixed issue in Current Time Service.

Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multirole S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
        Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
        increasing the connection interval.

    - ANT:
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time.

    - BLE:
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing
          examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two
          pages.

    - Proprietary:
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box
          with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
          The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
              hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
              hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
              hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
              hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy
          Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and
          channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the
              nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects
              (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the
              nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

========================================================================

              directed/fast/slow advertising, with and without whitelist.
            - Nordic UART Service (ble_nus), detached from the UART over BLE Example.
            - Added Current Time Service Client (ble_cts_c).
            - Service Changed characteristic has been implemented for DFU, so that the indication is
              sent when transitioning between application and bootloader.
            - Implemented a mechanism for sharing of IRK and LTK from application to bootloader.
              This allows for whitelist advertising and reconnection in DFU mode using existing
              keys.
        - Examples:
            - The UART over BLE Example is no longer experimental.
            - Added a Time Profile (ble_app_cts_c) example using the Current Time Service Client
              implementation.

            - TIMER (Timer/counter)
            - WDT (Watchdog timer)
        - Added modules:

Fixed issues:
    - Fixed pstorage issue where different applications could write to the same page.

Known issues:
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
         increasing the connection interval used by the master.

      Note 2: Some of the examples using the SoftDevice will not fit on the 128 kB variant of the
              chip.
      Note 3: Some of the serialization examples are too big to be compiled using the free version
              of Keil.

Supported SoftDevices:
    - S110 7.1.0
    - S120 1.0.1

    boards", or use SDK v6.x.x.

Changes:
    - ANT:
        - ANT-FS client example: Added callback to allow applications to execute custom code while
          waiting for the burst to complete
        - Major rework on ANT DFU example
        - Added new ANT hub-2-hub/shared channel example

        - Fixed memory corruption issue by using dedicated buffers for ANT and BLE stack events
          respectively on S310
        - Fixed an issue where the ANT OTA Updater application v0.8 would not support hex files
          with code size larger than 65535 bytes

Known issues:
    - SEGGER J-Link software has some issues with Keil.
      See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for details.
    - Keil 5.13 may issue a warning about missing packs even when all Nordic Semiconductor packs are
      correctly installed.

         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
         increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    - ANT:
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time

    - BLE:
        - NRFFOSDK-3135: S120 examples: RAM is limited to 16 kB, because S120 V1.0.1 does not
          support utilizing the whole flash on the QFACAB chip
        - NRFFOSDK-119: Only the ble_app_proximity_low_power and ble_app_hrs applications are power
          optimized
        - S120 examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120
          examples is that if the peer loses the bond and a rebonding occurs, flash clear fails and
          a DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing
          examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two
          pages.

                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy
          Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and
          channel tables require adjustment.

        - S120 examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if the peer loses the bond and a rebonding occurs, flash clear fails and a DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two pages.

    Proprietary:
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is a hardware-related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Changes:

    - Added partial support for Keil 5 uvprojx files.

    ANT
        - None

    ANT + BLE (Dual stack)

    BLE
        - New module device manager replaces bond manager for storing persistent data
        - Experimental device manager support for s120 (BLE central)
        - S110 serialization solution has been reworked

        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file.
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time.

    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - S120 Examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if peer loses the bond and a re-bonding occurs, flash clear fails, and DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - Device manager has a few APIs unimplemented. Also documentation providing examples of how API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device manager (pstorage) doesn't support update of bond split across two pages.

    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.

        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

    Proprietary
        - NRFFOETT-644 - Gazell / ESB: Fixed some documentation issues.

Known issues:

    - NRFFOSDK-2542 - SoftDevice related documentation for S110, S120 and S310 BLE stack is not consistent. When looking up SoftDevice application interface or message sequence charts, it is possible that one is looking at incorrect interface. Recommendation hence is to look at SoftDevice headers to ensure correct appplication interface. This is also applicable for Serialization library references. This will be fixed in next release.

    - When flashing from Keil 4, a pop-up might appear stating "Cannot Load Flash Device Description !".
          Solution:
            - Write new flash algorithm settings to the uvopt file.
                Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
                Select "Options for Target" -> "Utilities".
                Press "Settings" button to see flashing algorithms.
                Verify that "nRF51xxx" is in the list of flashing algorithms, if not add it by pressing the "Add" button.
                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists

    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms.
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firware update.
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file.
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time.

    ANT + BLE (Dual stack)
        - S310 Heart Rate Relay Example: Bonding does not always function as expected. If bonding is enabled using compiler flag it is recommended to perform service discovery before bonding to minimize chances of unexpected behavior.

        - NRFFOSDK-472 - Bonding information in flash are not erased during programming of a new application.
            (If the bonding information is not erased manually - by pressing button 1 during start-up - the new application might assert. )
        - S120 Examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if peer loses the bond and a re-bonding occurs, flash clear fails, and DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.

            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.

    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it.
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms.
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firware update.
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.

        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

      - Added support for image transfer over BLE.
      - HCI Transport Layer used for serial transfer.
      - Note: This example is implemented to work on nRF6310 motherboard because it uses Button 7 to enter bootloader mode on reset.
	      This is because Button 0 and Button 1 are used by other SDK applications as wakeup buttons.
	      If this example is to be changed to work for evaluation kit board, then this should be taken into consideration.
      - PC application examples for performing firmware updates using HCI and BLE added in nrf6310\device_firmware_updates\experimental folder.

    - UICR Configuration example added to the SDK. It can be found in nrf6310\uicr_config_example folder.

        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".

========================================================================

nRF51 SDK v. 4.3.0
------------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
    - ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.60
	- GCC: gcc-arm-embedded 4.7 2013q1
    - N51422 QFAACA on PCA10003 evaluation kit board
    - N51822 QFAACA on PCA10004/5 module on nRF6310 motherboard
    - Windows XP SP3 32 bit
    - Windows 7 SP1 64 bit
    - BLE SoftDevice Version : s110_nrf51822_5.2.0

Changes:

    - Supported GCC toolchain switched from CodeSourcery to gcc-arm-embedded.
        - New gcc startup file, linker scripts, and makefiles.
        - Updated CMSIS header files in Include/gcc to the latest revision (3.20).
        - Makefile target "all" now runs "clean" and "debug" targets instead of incremental "release" target.
    - nrf.h requires projects to have a define for a chip to enable some needed workarounds.
	- SDK examples now support PCA10000 v2.0.0. To make the examples work on the older PCA10000 v1.0, the UART pins need to be remapped in the pca10000.h header file.
		For v1.0
			#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  3
			#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  1
			#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 2
			#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 0
		For v2.0.0
			#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  11
			#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  9
			#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 10
			#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 8

    ANT
            - ANT examples have been updated to support the newest UART API.
    BLE
	    - HCI Transport Layer from Bluetooth Specification v4.0 introduced for BLE S110 Serialized Applications.
		- BLE S110 Serialization Examples released as part of the main SDK.
		- Updated serialized ble_app_advertising and ble_app_hrs to use app_scheduler.
	    - Connection Parameter update module : Added possibility to request different connection parameters multiple times. A new event, BLE_CONN_PARAMS_EVT_SUCCEEDED has been created. Event handler implementation needs to take this into account, especially if they were implemented to trigger a disconnect regardless of the type of event.
		- Added Makefile and Eclipse project file for ble_app_hrs.
		- Changed hard coded flash pages to be FICR CODESIZE dependent.

    Proprietary
        - Gazell:
			- Added Gazell Pairing Host source code and board example. Backwards compatible with nRF24L Gazell Pairing Device and Host modules.
			- Added function nrf_gzll_set_auto_disable(uint32_t num_ticks), to disable Gazell after a number of timeslots.
			- Added function nrf_gzll_get_tick_count().
			- Gazell Pairing Device now uses nrf_gzll_get_tick_count() in order to implement a delay. This reduces current consumption.
			- Default sync_lifetime value has been increased to 3*channel_table_size*number_of_timeslots_per_channel. This improves performance in high-interference environments. Current users who are satisfied with the performance may wish to maintain the minimum value of 1*channel_table_size*number_of_timeslots_per_channel, in order to avoid any slight increase in current consumption.
        - Enhanced ShockBurst:
			- ESB PTX now calls nrf_esb_tx_success() callback instead of nrf_esb_tx_failed() for NOACK packets.
			- Fix in nrf_esb_set_mode()
        - Information concerning backwards compatibility with nRF24L devices has been moved to the User Guide.

Fixed issues:

    - Examples doing flash writes were not waiting for writes to finish.

    ANT
	    - NRFFOSDK-1312 - Changed ANTFS_TRANSMIT_POWER define in antfs.h from 0 to 3. The define previously had an incorrect definition which set the power value to -20dBm instead of 0dBm even though the comment indicated 0dBm.

    BLE
	    - NRFFOETT-402 - DFU Bootloader application in experimental project now sets stack pointer correctly before executing reset vector of application.

    Proprietary
	    - NRFFOETT-301 - Radio example uses obsolete RADIO_TXPOWER_TXPOWER_Neg40dBm definition.
        - Fixed issue in TWI HW driver. Event was not cleared before waiting it to get cleared.
        - Floating point ABI used by Makefiles was incorrect. Now using mabi-float=soft.
        - Gazell/ESB: Fixed set_mode() functionality.
        - Gazell GCC board examples startup and run correctly with the GCC libraries.
        - A Gazell Device nows stop the RSSI measurement when no ACK is received, improving the base current consumption.

    Bluetooth:
          - The buttons on the evaluation board are not debounced.

Known issues:
    - Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
      Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it. (DRGN-1807)
    - Reset button won't work after programing without cycling the target power. (DRGN-1885)

        - ble_bondmngr_store_bonded_masters function from the bond manager cannot be used when advertising nor when in a connection (DRGN-1915)
         (flash erase/write prevents the CPU from running which means the stack will not be able to run properly.)
          If ble_bondmngr_store_bonded_masters function is called while advertising or in a connection, the behavior is UNDEFINED.

    Proprietary:
        - ESB/Gazell: Calling nrf_esb_init() or nrf_gzll_init() will disable usage of the GPIOTE peripheral. In order to use the GPIOTE peripheral, the workaround in PAN 22 must be performed after calling these functions.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.

        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready
          SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
        - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
        - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
        - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.

          The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the
          nRF51 examples:

          hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
          hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
          hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
          hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);

          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the
          payloads received in ACK.

        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible
          with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx
          devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects,
          or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects
          (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects,
          or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

- Examples use depracated PERPOWER register. Future silicon will power up peripherals after reset and PERPOWER register will be removed.
- Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
- Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in
- Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
- On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
  Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
- Gazell and ESB examples point to wrong SFR file (should be SFD\Nordic\nRF51\nRF51822.sfr).
- Reset button wont work after programing without cycling the target power. Workaround is to update system_nrf51.c with
  void SystemInit (void)
  {
      /* Switch ON both RAM banks */
      NRF_POWER->RESET = POWER_RESET_RESET_Enabled;
      NRF_POWER->RAMON |= (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM0_RAM0On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM0_Pos) |
                          (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_RAM1On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_Pos);
  }

Bluetooth:
  - The button on the evaluation board are not debounced in hardware and the application implementing for it does not debounce the button presses either (using software mechanisms). So there will be additional increments/decrements of heart rate measurement while pressing the buttons.

nRF514 SDK v.1.2.0
------------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.60
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10004 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10006 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51822 QFAACA on nRF2752 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51822 QFAACA on PCA10001 evaluation kit board
- Windows XP SP3 32-bit
- Windows 7 SP1 64-bit

Changes:
- Added Bicycle Power minimal slave example.
- Added Stride and Distance Monitor minimal slave and master example.
- Removed deprecated PERPOWER register from examples and header files.

Known issues:
- Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
- On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
  - Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
- When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it.
- Flashing a software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode (implies to wake-up the current application from SYTEM_OFF before flashing a new application)
- Reset button won't work after programming with Keil without cycling the target power. On the other hand if nrfjprog with -p (pin reset) is used to program the device, reset button will work.
- Using -p option in nrfjprog too heavily might block JLink. This block can be resolved by re-cycling the JLink power.


nRF514 SDK v1.1.0
-----------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.54
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10001 module
- N51422 QFAACA on a PCA10005 modulea on nRF6310 motherboard

Known issues:
- When having an application which starts up by putting the chip in SystemOff mode, and wakeup source is not configured correctly, the device cannot be programmed.
  Workaround: Use nrfjprog with "recover" option to wipe the application keeping the application in SystemOff mode.
- For PCA10003 examples using UART, the terminal program on the PC has to release the COM port when PCA10003 is power cycled. It is not possible for the PCA10003 to keep a connection up when performing a power cycle.
  Workaround: Close terminal program for each time you want to perform a power recycle

Changes:
- Added examples for PCA10003 Evaluation kit.
- Added nrfjprog.exe - Nordic Semiconductor command line nRF51 programming tool using JLink dll's.
- Added custom system_nrf51422.c in templates folder for handling reset after flashing and turning all peripherals on (except GPIOTE) as described in PAN028.
- Removed references to depricated PERPOWER register in ANT code examples.
- Added compiler flag to the ANT examples, to easier being able to run examples without any UART.
- Modified simple_uart_config() parameters. Added new parameters for flow control
- Added include/boards folder for handling examples targeted for different boards
- Fixed bug in timer_example
- Fixed bug in spi_example
