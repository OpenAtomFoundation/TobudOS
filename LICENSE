The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Open Source Software Licensed Under the BSD-style licenses but there is a significant feature. 

1. FATFS R0.13c  
Copyright (C) 2018, ChaN, all right reserved.

Terms of the BSD-style licenses

FatFs module is an open source software. Redistribution and use of FatFs in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following condition is met:

1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this condition and the following disclaimer.
This software is provided by the copyright holder and contributors "AS IS" and any warranties related to this software are DISCLAIMED.

The copyright owner or contributors be NOT LIABLE for any damages caused by use of this software.

Therefore FatFs license is one of the BSD-style licenses but there is a significant feature. FatFs is mainly intended for embedded systems. In order to extend the usability for commercial products, the redistributions of FatFs in binary form, such as embedded code, binary library and any forms without source code, does not need to include about FatFs in the documentations. This is equivalent to the 1-clause BSD license. Of course FatFs is compatible with the most of open source software licenses including GNU GPL. When you redistribute the FatFs source code with any changes or create a fork, the license can also be changed to GNU GPL, BSD-style license or any open source software license that not conflict with FatFs license.
